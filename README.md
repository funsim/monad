A purely functional, dependently typed systems programming language that
compiles to native binaries through LLVM. The compiler is written in Monad
and compiles itself.

Homepage: **[monad-lang.org](https://monad-lang.org)**

## Why Monad?

- **Dependent types** — types can depend on values, with a `Prop` universe
  and propositional equality for compile-time proofs
- **Type classes** — ad-hoc polymorphism with automatic instance resolution
- **Termination checking** — recursive definitions must be structurally
  decreasing unless you opt out
- **Hygienic macros** — `defmacro`, `quote`, and compile-time reflection;
  `#[derive]` is implemented in Monad, not in the compiler
- **LLVM native** — programs compile to fast native binaries, no VM
- **Self-hosting** — the compiler in `lang/` is written in Monad and compiles
  itself, reaching a fixpoint where the binary builds its own successor

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monad-lang/monad/main/scripts/monadup -o monadup
chmod +x monadup
./monadup self-install
export PATH="$HOME/.monad/bin:$PATH"
monadup default       # install the latest nightly and make it active
monad version
```

`monadup` manages nightly builds under `~/.monad`. Use `monadup list`, `monadup
use <tag>`, `monadup update`, and `monadup uninstall <tag>` to manage installed
versions. Nightlies are Linux x86_64 and currently need Nix store paths; building
from source is the portable alternative.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://tangled.org/monad-lang.org/monad
cd monad
devenv shell          # provides Rust, clang, llc, Boehm GC, mdbook
cargo build --release
cargo run --release -- run cli/src/main.mo build cli/src/main.mo -o "$PWD/monad" --release
```

The compiler the flake builds is published to the project's Cachix cache. A
`nix build --accept-flake-config .#monad` reads it with no setup; `cachix use
monad-lang` opts in permanently by adding the substituter to your `nix.conf`, so
an unchanged rung is a substitution rather than a ~20 minute interpretation.

The `-o` must be **absolute**: a relative output name lands in the compiler's
scratch directory. The trailing `--release` turns off DWARF debug info, which
is on by default.

## Quick start

```monad,check
use std::io {}
open IO {println}

def main (args : List String) : IO Unit := println "Hello, World!"
```

Save that as `hello.mo`, then:

```bash
monad run hello.mo
```

`monad run` compiles and executes in one step — a Monad program is always a
native binary. To keep the binary, use `monad build` with an absolute output
path:

```bash
monad build hello.mo -o "$PWD/hello"
./hello
```

## Commands

```text
monad build [<path>] [name] [--bin <name>] [--output/-o <name>] [--verbose/-v] [--debug/-g] [--release]
        Parse, type-check and compile a source file, or a mote's [[bin]] target,
        to a native binary. --bin picks one of several.

monad run <path> [--verbose/-v] [--debug/-g] [--release]
        Compile and execute. The program's exit code becomes monad's.

monad eval <path> [--verbose/-v]
        Evaluate with the built-in interpreter. Pure programs only.

monad check [<path>...] [--workspace/-w] [--verbose/-v]
        Parse and type-check; no execution.

monad test [<path>...] [--workspace/-w] [--verbose/-v]
        Compile each file's #[test] defs and run them.

monad pretty <path>
        Parse and pretty-print a .mo source file.

monad version
        Print the git commit this binary was built from.
```

Running `monad` with no arguments prints usage. Directory arguments are
expanded recursively; with no path, commands operate on the mote containing
the working directory, and `--workspace` covers every mote in the workspace.
