/// The `check` cache: what a run already knows, and where it says so.
///
/// Phase 2b of plans/packaging/mote-build-deps-artifacts-targets.md. The
/// governing rule is "only cache safe and expensive work", and both
/// halves of it are decided here rather than assumed:
///
///   * SAFE. The key covers the file's own bytes, the digest of its
///     mote's whole declared closure, and the identity of the running
///     compiler. Where any of those cannot be determined the cache turns
///     itself OFF -- it never answers from a weaker key. The specific
///     trap is documented at `Build.compiler_digest_with`: `build_commit`
///     does NOT change when an uncommitted `lang/` edit is rebuilt, and
///     that is the normal state of this repository.
///
///   * EXPENSIVE. A corpus `check` is 789 seconds over 195 files and the
///     pre-commit hook runs one on every commit. A single-file check is
///     not that (`Build.check_worth_caching`).
///
/// Two shapes here are deliberately NOT what a naive cache would do, and
/// both are load-bearing:
///
///   * **Record per file, never split the run.** `run_check_loop` threads
///     ONE `ModuleInfoCache`, which is what makes a file's dependency
///     closure free once an earlier file has loaded it -- measured at 75%
///     of dependency loads on a 5-file run. Per-file INVOCATIONS of the
///     checker throw that away, and are why one big file alone never
///     finishes while all 195 together are 789 seconds. So a hit is
///     replayed in place, inside the one loop, and the misses among it run
///     in the same single invocation they always did.
///
///   * **A hit cannot be less informative than a miss.** Entries store the
///     rendered output verbatim, so a replay is byte-exact -- see
///     `Build.check_block`.
