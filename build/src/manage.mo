///
/// **The layout respected here is what exists, not what the plan
/// sketched.** The fuller layout (`db/<hash>.json`, `.gc-roots/`,
/// symlinked profiles) has no writer yet. Two entry kinds are populated
/// today:
///
///   * `<target-dir>/store/<hash>` and `<hash>.ll` -- an artifact as a
///     SIBLING PAIR. The IR is not decoration: it is the file `llc` is
///     actually pointed at, so dropping one of the two is a bug and both
///     verbs below treat the pair as one entry.
///   * `<target-dir>/check/<hash>/{out,errors}` -- a check result.
///
/// `<target-dir>/test/` and `db/` are empty (2c is unimplemented, and
/// `db/` has no writer), which is why `store ls` cannot source a
/// human-readable name from `db/<hash>.json` and `verify` checks two kinds
/// rather than three. Saying that out loud is part of the job: a column
/// that is always empty is worse than a sentence that says why.
///
/// **A management verb may fall back to doing LESS; it must never fall
/// back to a weaker decision.** A cache may respond to an uncomputable key
/// by doing the work. A `gc` has no such fallback -- its decision is what
/// to DELETE -- so the same failure has to stop it instead. That asymmetry
/// is the whole of `Build.reach_of` below.
