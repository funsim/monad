// bare-name namespace, last registration winning — so two bare `greet`s
// resolve to whichever module happens to be registered later, not to the one

// Regression cover for `implementations/do-bind-binder-untyped.md`: `let q <- e`
// with no annotation used to leave `q` typed as a hole, so `q.count` -- which
// desugars to a bare `{ count, .. }` field pattern -- failed with "cannot
// resolve `{ .. }`: the matched value's type isn't known here". The read has to
// be through the binder AND on the binder's own type. Reading it through a
// named accessor def instead (`counter_count q`) does NOT discriminate and was
// tried first: `try_type_check_def_call` runs ahead of the hole-based path in
// `type_check_app` and checks the argument against the def's declared parameter
// type, so the binder gets a real type from there whatever the callee is.
// `IO.pure`/`Monad.bind` is a class method with no registered signature, so a
// real do-bind has no such rescue.
