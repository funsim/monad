  # one rung of the ladder and reads the rung below it as a PACKAGE
  # (`config.packages.monadHost`) rather than as a function applied to it, so
  # the modules can be read, built and cached one at a time:
  #
  #   nix/host.nix     packages.monadHost  the Rust interpreter (rung 0)
  #   nix/monad.nix    packages.monad      rung 1, built by scripts/
  #   nix/bootstrap.nix checks.bootstrap   the fixpoint rung 1 asserts
  #
  # The facts the three of them share are passed as explicit import arguments
  # rather than through `_module.args`: they are not module-system state, they
  # are what this flake knows about itself, and `import`-arguments cannot be
  # silently shadowed by a module that happens to declare the same option.
