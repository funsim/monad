// directory of an INSTALLED toolchain -- what `scripts/monadup` unpacks
// into `~/.monad/downloads/<tag>/` and marks active with `~/.monad/
// active`. This section discovers that directory.
//
// What consumes it is `module.mo` (module resolution), `lang/src/
// codegen/test/*` and `cli/src/main.mo` (the C runtime), so nothing here
// knows about modules or files beyond joining segments: `module.mo`
// imports THIS file, so the dependency cannot run the other way.
//
// Every function that touches the environment or the filesystem has its
// DECISION factored out into a pure one beside it. That is not style:
// there is no `set_env` native in this corpus and the test runner is one
// process, so a branch that reads an environment variable can only be
// exercised from outside it. The pure half is what a row can assert.

/// carries one, reduced to `none` when there is nothing usable in it.

/// so those CONTENTS carry a trailing newline which must not survive into
/// a path: `downloads/nightly-1\n` is a directory that never exists, and
/// the failure mode of keeping it is a silent "no toolchain installed".
