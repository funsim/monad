/// What a hover and a go-to-definition need from a checked file: the
/// identifier under the cursor, resolved to the declaration it names, with
/// enough of that declaration to show it and to jump to it.
///
/// ONE CALL SERVES BOTH FEATURES, and that is the shape rather than an
/// accident. Hover and definition ask different questions about the same
/// answer -- hover wants the declaration's type, definition wants its
/// position -- and `NavTarget` is that answer whole: a caller that only
/// wants a detail reads `nav_target_detail`, one that only wants a jump
/// reads `nav_target_range` and `nav_target_file`, and neither re-runs the
/// resolution. So there is exactly one entry point (`nav_at`, or
/// `nav_at_checked` for the ordinary caller that already has a check
/// result) rather than one per feature, and the two features cannot drift
/// apart in which names they resolve or how.
///
/// RESOLUTION IS THE COMPILER'S, NOT A SECOND OPINION. Every name goes
/// through `scope_resolve_name`, which is the call `infer.mo`,
/// `lower_core_ir.mo` and `module.mo` already resolve names with -- so a
/// name that typechecks resolves, a name that does not does not, and the
/// editor and the checker never disagree about whether an identifier means
/// something. A language server that re-implemented name lookup would be a
/// second implementation of the corpus's most load-bearing rule, and would
/// disagree with it exactly where the rule is subtle (a `::` spelling that
/// is a compiler-minted flat name, an `open`-aliased name, a promoted
/// instance method).
///
/// RESOLVING IS NOT THE SAME AS KNOWING WHAT IT IS, and that was measured
/// rather than assumed. `scope_resolve_name` answers a `ScopeDef` for a
/// TYPE name and for a CONSTRUCTOR name as readily as for a def -- the
/// first cut of this module read that as "it is a def" and answered
/// `def Color` for an inductive and `def red` for a constructor, the latter
/// with no range at all because the outline is keyed by the type's name.
/// So the FILE'S OWN OUTLINE is what decides the kind, the vocabulary and
/// the detail order: an identifier the outline names is answered with the
/// kind the file gives it (`def`, `type`, `struct`, `class`, `instance`,
/// ...) and a detail composed for that kind, and only an identifier the
/// outline does NOT name goes looking through the scope for a type, a
/// constructor, a class, or -- for a `use`d def -- a def with a file.
/// That also makes the outline the authority a user can see for
/// themselves, and gives the good behaviour for free: a declaration the
/// file declares but the checker could not resolve (a typo in its own type
/// annotation) still gets a jump target, because being in the outline is
/// enough to know where it is.
///
/// THE KEYS LINE UP BY CONSTRUCTION, which is what makes the range lookup
/// work at all. `DeclRange.name` for a def is `show_name_path (Def.name df)`
/// and the name a resolution answers with is that same `Def.name` rendered
/// -- the declaration's own `NamePath`, module or no module -- so the
/// string one side produces is the string the other is keyed by, with no
/// re-derivation on either side. The signature side tables agree for the
/// same reason: `ScopeData.def_sigs` and `def_return_types` are registered
/// under `defname` (`scope.mo`'s `build_scope_def`), which is the same
/// value.
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, all of it stated rather than silently absent:
///
/// - **Locals are not resolved.** `scope_resolve_name` takes a
///   `LocalScope`, and this passes the empty one. `LocalVar` carries no
///   location and `Term.var` is positional, so resolving a local properly
///   means walking the term tree from the declaration that encloses the
///   cursor -- the walk the Rust server this replaces explicitly declined
///   to do, and its own doc comment records the resulting defect: a local
///   shadowing a top-level def resolves to the top-level one. This cut
///   does not fix that; it inherits it deliberately, because the fix is a
///   new piece of work (a cursor-to-binding walk) rather than a parameter.
///   The visible consequence: `gd` on a local that does NOT shadow anything
///   answers no target, correctly; on one that DOES it answers the
///   top-level def, which is wrong.
/// - **A type's file is not known.** `ScopeDef` carries its `ModulePath`;
///   `Inductive` and `Class` do not, so a cross-file jump is offered for
///   defs and not for types and classes. Hover is unaffected -- a detail
///   needs no file -- and an in-file jump works for all of them.
/// - **A bare constructor name can be ambiguous.** The constructor index is
///   a scan that answers the first match, so hovering `some` in a corpus
///   with two types that declare it shows one of them. The scope's own doc
///   records this ambiguity as a real hazard for TYPECHECKING; for a hover
///   it is a display choice, and the alternative (withholding the answer)
///   is worse.
/// - **No hover text is composed for a module or a `use`.** Those resolve
///   to nothing at all here rather than to a made-up shape.
///
/// NOTHING HERE IS IO, and that is a deliberate boundary: this module
/// answers what the compiler knows, and reading the file a target lives in
/// is the caller's job (`decl_ranges_of_source` is public for exactly that
/// reason). It keeps `nav_at` usable from a pure test and keeps the
/// filesystem out of a module whose whole subject is name resolution.
