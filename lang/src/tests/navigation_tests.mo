/// Resolution for the editor: an identifier under the cursor resolved to the
/// declaration it names, with a detail to show and a place to go.
///
/// THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THE KEY AGREEMENT. `nav_at` resolves a name
/// through `scope_resolve_name` and then looks the result up in the file's
/// declaration-range table BY NAME -- and the two sides agree only because
/// both derive that name from the same `Def.name` (`ScopeDef.name` is
/// registered from it, `DeclRange.name` is rendered from it). Nothing in
/// the type system enforces that, and if it ever stopped being true the
/// failure would be silent: a hover with no range, every jump in the file
/// degrading to "found nothing" while still resolving correctly. So the
/// assertions below are deliberately about the PAIR -- a name AND a line --
/// rather than about either alone.
///
/// The two halves are pinned separately too. A def that resolves but has no
/// range (the cross-module case, built by hand below) proves the name half
/// does not depend on the range half; the `detail` assertions prove the
/// signature comes from `ScopeData.def_sigs` and not from `ScopeDef.sig`,
/// which is `Term.hole` for every def in the corpus and would render a
/// hover reading `_` (the plan's Risk #6).
///
/// VACUITY IS THE HAZARD HERE, more than in most files, because "resolved
/// nothing" and "resolved to nothing" are the same value. Every test that
/// asserts an absence asserts a PRESENCE in the same test -- the same name
/// on a scope that works resolves, and the empty answer is compared against
/// that -- so a scope that failed to build cannot pass for an editor that
/// correctly found no target.
///
/// THE `IO Bool` TESTS USE THE STATEMENT FORM of `let` (`let x : T := e;`),
/// never `let … in`: inside a `do` block the latter aborts the parse at the
/// NEXT top-level declaration rather than where it was written, which is a
/// recorded trap in this repository and an expensive one to diagnose. The
/// pure helpers above them have no `do` block, so they use `in` freely.
///
/// Field reads go through typed accessor defs (`nt_*`), never inline, per
/// this repository's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen hazard.
/// The `nt_` prefix keeps whole-program scope clean.
