// the `PathP` rules -- peeling a path type into its parts, recognizing the
// bare interval, recognizing an endpoint. Deliberately free of checker
// state: everything here is a `Term` -> `Term`/`Option` question, so this
// module imports only `lang/types.mo` and the formation/boundary rules
// that need the checker's scope and local types live in
// `lang/typecheck/infer.mo` next to the arms that call them (they need
// `nth_type`, which is infer's own local-type lookup, and importing infer
// from here would be a cycle).
