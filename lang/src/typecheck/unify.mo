/// Structural type unification. Returns the unified type.
/// Holes match anything. Pi matches Pi structurally.
/// App spines are congruent: heads and arguments compare separately.
/// Sorts respect cumulativity (level ≤ expected_level).
/// A non-explicit binder -- a quantified type variable or a universe level,
/// which `Term.forall` used to spell -- is stripped before comparison, on
/// either side.
/// Peels both sides at entry rather than adding a `Term.ctx` arm to each
/// of the four matches below. Every one of them tests SHAPE with a `_ =>`
/// fallback, so a wrapper would not crash -- a wrapped `Term.pi` would just
/// fall through to `Similar.similar` and report a spurious mismatch, which
/// is the silent kind of wrong.
///
/// Placement rule R1 says a wrapper never reaches a type position and so
/// never reaches here at all. This peels anyway: the recursive calls below
/// go through `unify`, so one peel at the top covers every level.
///
/// CONVERSION CHECKING. `scope`/`locals` are here for definitional
/// equality: when the structural comparison fails, both sides are
/// reduced to weak-head normal form (`lang/typecheck/whnf.mo`) and
/// compared once more, so a type still written as an unreduced
/// application (`identity_type foo`) is compared against what it
/// computes to (`Bool`) instead of being rejected on its spelling.
///
/// Reduction happens ONLY on the failing path, never at entry. Three
/// reasons, in order of how much they matter:
///   1. Cost. `unify` is hot; this way the succeeding comparison -- the
///      overwhelming majority -- does no extra work at all.
///   2. It can only ever ACCEPT more. Reduction is reached exactly
///      where an error was about to be returned, so no program that
///      type-checked before can start failing.
///   3. It bounds the recursion. One retry, on already-reduced
///      operands, cannot re-enter reduction.
///
/// `#[terminating]`: `term_peel` strictly removes wrappers, so the pair it
/// hands `unify_go` is smaller, but that is not a structural subterm the
/// checker can see.
