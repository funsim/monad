// ─── Weak-head normal form ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Conversion checking: two types are definitionally equal when they
// REDUCE to the same thing, not only when they are written the same
// way. `lang/typecheck/unify.mo` compares `Term`s structurally, so a
// declared type that is still an unreduced application (`identity_type
// foo`) never gets compared against what it computes to (`Bool`). This
// module supplies the missing reduction step; `unify` calls it only
// after a structural comparison has already failed, so the happy path
// pays nothing.
//
// Four reduction rules, which is what conversion checking at this stage
// needs:
//
//   beta   `(fn x => body) arg`  ->  `body[x := arg]`
//   delta  a free `Term.var` naming a global def  ->  that def's body
//   iota   `match c { K xs => body }` (c a KNOWN constructor
//          application) -> `body[xs := c's fields]`; same for `if` on
//          `Bool.true`/`Bool.false`
//   demorgan  the interval's lattice simplifications (Stage 1 step 5,
//          `whnf_cubical` below): `ineg i0 -> i1`, `imeet i1 j -> j`, ...
//
// Beta and delta are needed together, and neither is useful alone
// here: a type-level application like `identity_type foo` is headed by
// a FREE variable, not a `Term.lam`, so beta has nothing to fire on
// until delta has unfolded the head into the `Term.lam` chain a `def`'s
// body actually is (`def_params_of_term`, `lang/scope.mo`). Iota sits on
// top of both: a scrutinee like `f P.p0` only becomes a constructor
// application after delta and beta have had their turn.
//
// Iota is the delicate one because `Literal.match_`'s arms are a
// binding form that binds `List.length args` de Bruijn levels at once
// (AGENTS.md item 22) -- substituting several levels simultaneously is
// where this kind of code goes subtly wrong; see
// `whnf_subst_case_fields`'s own doc comment for the exact trap.
//
// Iota is also step 1 of the eliminator roadmap recorded in
// `plans/type-system/match-to-recursor.md`: iota -> dependent index
// refinement -> `Eq.rec` as a real def -> optionally generating `T.rec`
// per inductive. Converting `match` to recursors would need this same
// reduction machinery (a primitive recursor reduces by a MORE complex
// rule than this arm), so this arm is the cheap half of that path
// either way.
//
// There is no metavariable handling here because this checker has no
// metavariables: `Term.hole` is a matches-anything wildcard, not a
// solvable meta (see `unify`'s own `Term.hole` arms). A reducer for a
// checker WITH metas would have to avoid committing to a reduction
// path before they are solved.

/// Default step budget. Conversion checking needs a handful of steps --
/// unfold a type-level def, beta it, look at the head -- so this is
/// generous rather than tight. It is a bound on DIVERGENCE, not a
/// tuning knob: the self-hosted compiler has no termination checker
/// yet, and `#[partial]` is applied to ~2000 defs in this tree, so

//
// The interval carries the free De Morgan algebra on dimension
// generators -- CCHM's cartesian cubes. Conversion of two dimension
// terms is syntactic identity (`Similar.similar`, which is what
// cartesian cubical type theory wants: interval conversion is DECIDED,
// never reduced to anything else), but only once both sides are in the
// form these rules compute. `imeet i1 j` and `j` are the same
// dimension, and nothing above `whnf` can see that until this step
// rewrites one to the other.
//
// The rules are the standard De Morgan simplifications, applied to
// ALREADY-REDUCED arguments -- arguments reduce first, so no rule ever
// fires on a still-reducible subterm and every step's result is built
// from pieces that are themselves in WHNF:
//
//   ineg i0       = i1
//   ineg i1       = i0
//   ineg (ineg i) = i            -- involutivity
//   imeet i0 _    = i0          -- the absorbing constant
//   imeet i1 j    = j           -- the unit
//   imeet i i     = i           -- idempotence
//   ijoin i1 _    = i1          -- dual of absorbing
//   ijoin i0 j    = j           -- dual of unit
//   ijoin i i     = i
//
// Deliberately absent: absorption (`imeet i (ijoin i j) = i`) and
// distribution. They are sound, but every rule here is one step at a
// SPINE head -- `whnf` is weak-head, and no argument position is ever
// re-entered -- while absorption has to look INSIDE an argument, which
// would make normalization quadratic in exchange for no conversion the
// current corpus asks of it. `sym (sym p) ≡ p` -- the one soundness pin
// Stage 2 has on this normalizer -- needs `ineg (ineg i) = i` and
// nothing more.
//
// Idempotence compares its two arguments with `Similar.similar`, which
// peels `Term.ctx` on both sides -- the debug-transparency property --

// two indices are similar or they are not.
