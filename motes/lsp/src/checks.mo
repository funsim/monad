/// What the checker knows about each open document: the last check of its text,
/// and the module cache those checks share.
///
/// THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON A LONG-LIVED SERVER IS WORTH HAVING. A cold `check`
/// reloads and re-elaborates a file's entire dependency closure, and parsing is most
/// of that cost; a server that paid it per keystroke would be slower than the command
/// line it replaces. `ModuleInfoCache` is what stands between the two: it holds every
/// module loaded so far in this session, so the second check of a file loads nothing,
/// and the hundredth check of a file in a project the server has been running against
/// all morning starts from a cache that is already complete. The cache is threaded
/// FORWARD rather than copied: `check_file_cached_from_source_ranged` answers the
/// cache it used, extended with whatever it had to load, and that value is what is
/// stored back here.
///
/// IT IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM `documents.mo`, AND THE TWO ARE ABOUT DIFFERENT
/// THINGS. `documents.mo` holds what the CLIENT says each buffer contains -- a view
/// that moves on every keystroke, including keystrokes that change nothing a checker
/// sees. This holds what the CHECKER derived from some revision of it, which moves
/// only when a check runs. Keeping them apart is what lets the two have different
/// lifetimes: closing a document ends the client's interest in that text while the
/// module cache it warmed stays, for every other file in the project.
///
/// THE TEXT A CHECK WAS COMPUTED FROM IS STORED NEXT TO IT, for the reason
/// `toolkit::docstore` stores a version next to its text: the two are useful only
/// together. A warm recheck is worth having only if what it reuses is an answer about
/// the text NOW in the buffer, and "is this check current?" has a cheap answer when
/// the text is here (`checkstore_is_current`) and no answer at all when it is not. It
/// also makes skipping unchanged text a property of THIS store rather than a flag
/// every caller must remember to consult: a caller that skips the flag re-checks
/// identical text and is merely slower, never wrong.
///
/// A DOCUMENT WITH NO PATH IS NOT CHECKED. The checker is handed a filesystem path
/// and walks it for dependencies, so an `untitled:` buffer has nothing to check
/// against and no dependencies to load. Nothing is recorded for it, which makes every
/// reader of this module answer "no check" -- the same state a document that was never
/// opened is in, and the honest one, rather than a check of an empty string that would
/// report a nonexistent file as clean.
///
/// NOTHING HERE WRITES TO STDOUT. The check path prints eagerly -- `IO.println`, one
/// destination -- and the rule this server lives under is that stdout carries protocol
/// frames and nothing else, so a printing path reached from the server turns a log
/// line into a malformed frame the client rejects. This module adds no printing; the
/// printing already inside the dependency walk is a real hazard with a named place in
/// the plan, not something a caller here can suppress.
