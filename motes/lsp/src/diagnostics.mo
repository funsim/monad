/// `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`: what the checker found, as the notification an
/// editor renders as markers.
///
/// THE RANGE IS ALREADY ON THE DIAGNOSTIC, and where it came from is worth knowing
/// before reading anything here. It is DECLARATION granularity: the checker pairs each
/// error with the span of the declaration it was raised in, not with the expression
/// that failed (`lang/src/module.mo`'s ranged check path, and Phase 0's probe verdict
/// that no located term survives into a `TypeError` payload). That is what the Rust
/// server this replaces shipped, so it is not a regression -- but it is the reason a
/// squiggle covers a whole `def` rather than the operator inside it, and it is the
/// thing the follow-up (a location-carrying `TypeError`) would change.
///
/// SEVERITY IS UNIFORMLY "error" TODAY, and that is a statement about the checker, not
/// a decision taken here: every diagnostic it produces is a hard failure, because
/// `check` fails a file for any of them. `toolkit::diagnostic` carries all four
/// severities and picks error, so the day the checker grows a warning the only change
/// is which one it picks -- the wire already has the field.
///
/// THE VERSION IS THE CLIENT'S, and it is sent when the client has one. See
/// `lsp_publish_notification`.
