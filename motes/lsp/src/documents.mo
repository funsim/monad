/// The document notifications: `didOpen`, `didChange`, `didClose` and `didSave`.
///
/// A NOTIFICATION HAS NO REPLY, so a malformed one cannot be reported to the
/// client at all -- which is why every entry point here answers an `Option` and
/// the server logs the absence and carries on. The one thing that must not happen
/// is a crash: a client sends a notification for every keystroke a user makes, so a
/// server that dies on a malformed one dies within seconds of the user typing
/// something surprising.
///
/// THE CHANGED FLAG IS THE DEBOUNCE, and it is worth being explicit about why the
/// debounce is a flag rather than a timer. Re-checking a file is the expensive thing
/// this server does, and a client sends `didChange` for edits that do not change
/// anything a checker sees -- a keystroke that is undone, a cursor movement a client
/// chose to report, an edit that arrives twice. Comparing the incoming text against
/// the buffer already held costs one pass and CANNOT BE WRONG, whereas the two
/// alternatives can: a hash can collide and silently skip a recheck, leaving a
/// diagnostic the user cannot clear, and a fiber timer under the Rust host blocks
/// the very thread that has to keep reading messages
/// (`std/src/concurrent/combine_test.mo:3-8` records that the host serializes
/// fibers by design, and `sleep_io` is a blocking sleep). So the cheapest correct
/// debounce is the one that asks the buffer whether anything actually changed.
///
/// THE VERSION IS NEVER INVENTED. `publishDiagnostics` may carry the version the
/// diagnostics were computed against, and a client that receives a version newer
/// than its buffer discards the whole set -- correct behaviour, and the mechanism by
/// which a server that reports the wrong version silently stops showing diagnostics
/// for a file that is being edited. So a version is recorded only when the client
/// stated one, and an absent one keeps whatever the document already had
/// (`document_version` has the argument and names the one value that is a
/// fallback).
