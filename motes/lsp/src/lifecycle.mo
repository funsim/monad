/// THE CAPABILITY LIST IS THE PROTOCOL, and advertising more than is implemented
/// is the one mistake here that cannot be walked back. A client believes the list:
/// advertising `completionProvider` and then answering `Method not found` puts a
/// completion popup in front of the user that fails on every keystroke, and
/// advertising `codeActionProvider` makes a client offer refactors this server
/// would have to refuse. The five capabilities below are exactly the five methods
/// `server.mo` answers -- diagnostics arrive as a notification and so are not
/// advertised at all -- and the list and the dispatcher are meant to be read
/// together.
///
/// ONE THING IS ADVERTISED THAT THE RUST SERVER DID NOT: `positionEncoding`. Its
/// absence is not neutral. A client that sees no `positionEncoding` in the result
/// is held to the specification's utf-16 default, so the old server was committed
/// to utf-16 whether or not it built its ranges that way -- and it built them from
/// byte offsets, which is the same thing only on pure ASCII. This server
/// NEGOTIATES: it picks from the client's offered list and echoes the winner, so
/// the conversion the ranges go through is the conversion the client will use to
/// read them. That single field is the difference between a squiggle under the
/// right characters and a squiggle that drifts one column per non-ASCII character
/// before it, in a corpus whose comments are full of em dashes and curly quotes.
