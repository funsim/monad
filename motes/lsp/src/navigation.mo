/// The four requests that answer with a place in the code: hover, definition,
/// `documentSymbol` and `workspace/symbol`.
///
/// HOVER AND DEFINITION ASK THE SAME QUESTION, and this module resolves it once.
/// Both are about the identifier under the cursor, and finding out which declaration
/// that identifier names -- through `lang`'s `nav_at_checked`, which is the
/// compiler's own `scope_resolve_name` -- is the whole of the work. What differs is
/// only which field of the answer is reported: hover shows `nav_target_detail` and
/// the identifier's extent, definition shows `nav_target_range` and the file. So
/// `lsp_cursor` resolves a cursor into a `Cursor` -- the identifier, its bytes, the
/// text, the line index, and the check -- and the two entry points below each read
/// what they want off it. A name that hovers and a name that jumps are then the same
/// set by construction, which is a property neither feature could have if each
/// resolved names on its own.
///
/// THE IDENTIFIER COMES FROM A TEXT SCAN, NOT FROM THE SYNTAX TREE, and that is the
/// one place this module is less precise than it could be. `text_identifier_at` finds
/// the run of identifier bytes containing the cursor, which is fast, total, and
/// correct for every cursor position a client can send -- including positions inside
/// comments and string literals, where there is no syntax tree node at all. The
/// alternative, walking the located term tree to the innermost node containing the
/// offset, would also decide which of two nested terms an identifier belongs to,
/// which matters for nothing here: the scan produces a NAME, and the name is resolved
/// by the compiler. Its one visible limit is that a run of bytes is not a scope, so a
/// local variable resolves to a top-level def of the same name -- inherited from the
/// resolver, and stated in `lang::navigation`'s own doc.
///
/// THE TEXT EVERY POSITION IS CONVERTED AGAINST IS THE CHECKED TEXT, which is why
/// these entry points take the check store and NOT the document store. A range from
/// the checker, a cursor position from the client, and the line index they meet in are
/// then all about one revision by construction rather than by agreement -- the
/// invariant being that the server re-checks a document whenever the client's text
/// changes, so a check is current whenever a request about the document is answered.
/// `documentSymbol` and `workspace/symbol` are the two exceptions to taking no
/// docstore: the second reads open buffers in preference to the disk (see
/// `lsp_file_text`), and neither depends on the invariant.
///
/// `documentSymbol` READS THE OUTLINE, NOT THE SCOPE, which is what makes the symbol
/// picker work in a file that does not compile. The declaration table survives a
/// truncated parse (`lang`'s `ranged_truncation` keeps the ranges and drops the
/// scope, deliberately), so a user who has just typed half a definition still gets
/// every other declaration in the file from the picker. Reading the scope instead
/// would answer nothing at exactly the moment the feature is most useful.
///
/// HOVER SHOWS A DECLARATION, NOT A TYPE. It renders the detail `lang::navigation`
/// composed -- a signature for a def, the whole declaration for a type or a class --
/// in a markdown fence, because a type's rendering is multi-line and a client that
/// reflowed it would destroy the layout that carries the meaning.
