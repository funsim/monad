/// textDocument, so invalid params". Flattening it here would put that decision in
/// a helper that cannot know the method, and the flattening is one line at the
/// call site.
///
/// The nesting is spelled out per call -- `lsp_param_nested "textDocument" "uri"`
/// -- rather than as a path string split on dots. The set of paths is small, the
/// specification fixes each one, and a path string is a place a typo is a silently
/// absent field instead of a call that does not compile.
