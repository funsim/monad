/// The loop, the state it threads, and the routing that turns a message into a reply.
///
/// THE LOOP IS SYNCHRONOUS AND THERE IS NO DEBOUNCE, and that is a decision with two
/// reasons behind it rather than an omission. The first is that a fiber timer cannot
/// work here: under the Rust host fibers do not overlap by design
/// (`std/src/concurrent/combine_test.mo` records that the concurrency test "fails on
/// any implementation that serializes fibers"), `fork_io` is a deferred thunk and
/// `sleep_io` a blocking sleep, so a fiber that sleeps to debounce a keystroke blocks
/// the very thread that has to keep reading messages. The second is that the debounce
/// this server actually needs is cheaper and cannot be wrong: `documents.mo` compares
/// the incoming text against the buffer it holds, and a change that does not move the
/// text costs nothing further. Anything more elaborate would be a timer that is worse
/// than the comparison it replaced.
///
/// STDOUT CARRIES PROTOCOL FRAMES AND NOTHING ELSE. This is the one invariant the
/// whole file is written around, and it is why every log line goes to
/// `IO.write_stderr` -- the check path this server drives prints eagerly to stdout in
/// `lang`'s loaders, so a path that reached one of those with verbose output on would
/// write a diagnostic into the middle of the protocol stream, and the client's
/// complaint would be about a malformed frame rather than about the print. So the
/// check is driven with `verbose := false` throughout (see `checks.mo`), and anything
/// this file wants to say it says on fd 2.
///
/// TWO DIFFERENT READS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A SYSCALL PER BYTE OF EVERY MESSAGE.
/// `IO.read_stdin_exact` answers a short read only at end of stream, so a caller
/// cannot simply ask for a large chunk and take what arrives -- it would block until
/// the chunk filled, which for a request/response protocol is a deadlock. What it CAN
/// do is ask for exactly the number of bytes the frame still needs, and
/// `framing_needed` is what answers that: while the header is still incomplete the
/// count is unknown and the reader takes one byte, and the moment `Content-Length` is
/// in hand it takes the body in a single read. So a message costs one read per header
/// byte plus one for the body, instead of one read per byte of everything.
///
/// END OF STREAM IS NOT AN ERROR. A client that closes the pipe -- an editor the user
/// quit, an editor that crashed -- has nothing left for this server to do, and a
/// server that exits non-zero because its peer went away turns every editor crash
/// into a failing build step. The one non-zero exit in the whole loop is the
/// specification's own: `exit` WITHOUT a preceding `shutdown` is a client that did not
/// get what it asked for, and it exits 1.
///
/// A MALFORMED FRAME DOES NOT END THE LOOP. The frame is answered with
/// `rpc_code_parse_error` and a null id, the buffer is dropped, and the stream is
/// resynchronized by consuming it one byte at a time -- which is the only resync
/// available, since a frame whose header could not be read does not say how long its
/// body is. A broken peer therefore spins the loop and terminates at end of stream,
/// while a well-behaved one never takes this path at all.
