/// Document-notification tests: what `didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose` leave behind.
///
/// THE `changed` FLAG IS WHAT THIS FILE MOSTLY TESTS, and it is not bookkeeping.
/// Re-checking a buffer is the expensive thing this server does, and a client sends
/// `didChange` for edits that change nothing a checker sees -- a keystroke that was
/// undone, a cursor movement it chose to report, an edit delivered twice. So the flag
/// is the debounce, and the debounce is a comparison of the incoming text against the
/// buffer already held: the one test that CANNOT be wrong. A test that only asserted
/// "the store holds the new text" would pass for a server that re-checks on every
/// keystroke, which is the failure the flag exists to prevent.
///
/// THE VERSION IS THE OTHER HALF, and its failure mode is the quietest in the whole
/// server. `publishDiagnostics` may carry the version its diagnostics were computed
/// against, and a client that receives a version NEWER than its buffer discards the
/// whole set -- so a server that invented a version, or kept a stale one, silently
/// stops showing diagnostics for a file the user is editing. Nothing errors. So the
/// absent-version cases below are pinned in both directions: a stated version wins,
/// and an absent one keeps what the document already had.
///
/// EVERY FIXTURE IS A NAMED DEF AND EVERY FIXTURE IS PINNED BY `ld_roundtrips`, for
/// the reason the sibling test files record: `ld_json` answers `null` for text that
/// does not parse, and every malformed-notification case here EXPECTS the absent
/// answer -- so a fixture with a missing brace would not fail, it would turn a
/// malformed-input test into a test of the malformed-input case, which passes. A
/// second consequence of the same guard: a fixture must be written with its keys in
/// WIRE ORDER, because `Json.to_string` walks a `BTreeMap` and re-sorts. That means
/// the fixture text below is the canonical form a client's re-encode would have, which
/// is a better fixture than a human's ordering.
///
/// Field reads go through the typed accessor defs below (`ld_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen hazard.
/// The `ld_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared with every
/// other mote's tests.
