/// Handshake tests: the encoding that was negotiated, the capabilities that were
/// advertised, and the workspace root that was read.
///
/// EVERY FIXTURE IS A NAMED DEF AND EVERY FIXTURE IS PINNED BY `lc_roundtrips`, and
/// that guard is the most important thing in this file. `lc_json` answers
/// `Json.make_null` for text that does not parse, and a `null` params node reads as
/// "the client offered nothing" -- which is exactly what several of these tests
/// expect to see. So a fixture with a missing brace does not fail; it turns the test
/// that uses it into a test of the default, which PASSES. This file shipped that bug
/// before the guard: three encoding fixtures were written with two closing braces
/// instead of three, and every assertion built on them was vacuous. Naming the
/// fixtures once and asserting each parses back to itself byte for byte is what makes
/// that class of typo loud, and it is why the guard is written as an exact round trip
/// rather than as "is an object".
///
/// THE CAPABILITY LIST IS ASSERTED AS AN EXACT WIRE STRING, for the same reason one
/// level up. Advertising a capability is not reversible from the client's side: a
/// client that sees `completionProvider` puts a completion popup in front of the user
/// and it fails on every keystroke if the server does not implement it. A test that
/// checked "the five fields are present" would pass just as happily with a sixth
/// field added by mistake, so the assertion is the whole object, byte for byte, and
/// adding a capability is a deliberate edit to this file.
///
/// The encoding tests are about a desynchronization rather than a preference: a
/// server that answers utf-8 to a client that will read utf-16 puts every range after
/// a non-ASCII character on the wrong column, and nothing in the protocol catches it.
/// The first-supported-choice rule is pinned in BOTH directions -- the same two
/// encodings, listed either way, must answer differently -- because a single
/// ordering passes for an implementation that ignores the client's order and always
/// picks its own favourite.
///
/// Field reads go through the typed accessor defs below (`lc_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `lc_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared with
/// every other mote's tests, and a sibling helper of the same name is a documented
/// miscompile.
