/// Params-reader tests: what a method's params say, and what a malformed one says.
///
/// THE WRONG-TYPE CASES ARE THE POINT. Reading a field that is present and correct is
/// not where a param reader breaks; it breaks on the input a real client sends when
/// it is confused -- a version as a string, a `textDocument` that is not an object,
/// an array where an element was expected -- and the failure it must not have is a
/// crash. A server that dies on one of these dies the first time a user types
/// something surprising, and it dies on a NOTIFICATION, where there is no reply to
/// deliver and nobody to tell. So every case below whose answer is `<none>` is a case
/// where the server goes on running and logs.
///
/// EVERY FIXTURE IS A NAMED DEF AND EVERY FIXTURE IS PINNED BY `lp_roundtrips`, and
/// the guard is the most important thing here rather than the last thing. Almost
/// every expectation in this file is `<none>`, and `lp_json` answers `null` for text
/// that does not parse -- which reads as `<none>` for all of them. So a fixture with a
/// missing brace does not fail a test, it turns the test into a test of the absent
/// case, which PASSES. This file shipped that shape of bug in a sibling file before
/// the guard was written; naming the fixtures once and asserting each parses back to
/// itself byte for byte is what makes the typo loud.
///
/// The guard is an EXACT round trip, which means it also requires each fixture's keys
/// to be in wire order -- `Json.to_string` walks a `BTreeMap`, so `{"b":1,"a":2}`
/// round-trips to the sorted spelling and fails the guard for that reason instead.
///
/// Fixtures are parsed from JSON TEXT rather than built with the constructors,
/// because the text is what a client actually sends -- a fixture built from
/// `Json.make_object` could be well-formed in a way no client's bytes ever are, and
/// the parse path is the one being exercised.
///
/// Field reads go through the typed accessor defs below (`lp_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `lp_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared with
/// every other mote's tests, and a sibling test file's helper of the same name is a
