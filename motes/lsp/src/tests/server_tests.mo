///
/// WHAT THESE TESTS COVER, AND WHAT THEY DELIBERATELY DO NOT. Everything below runs
/// against an EMPTY check store, so no file is read, no module graph is loaded and no
/// diagnostic is produced. That is the point rather than a limitation: what is pinned
/// here is the part of the server a client sees and a user cannot debug -- that
/// `initialize` answers with the encoding it was offered, that a request before the
/// handshake is refused with the code that says so, that an unknown method is ANSWERED
/// rather than ignored, and that `exit` without `shutdown` exits non-zero. A client that
/// gets any of those wrong hangs or desynchronizes, and neither shows up as a wrong
/// squiggle. The engine itself is `lang`'s, covered by `lang`'s tests and by the session
/// replay script, which is where a real file's diagnostics belong.
///
/// THE FIXTURES ARE LITERAL WIRE MESSAGES rather than calls to `toolkit::jsonrpc`'s
/// encoders, and that is deliberate. A test that built its request with the same module
/// the server parses with would pass while both sides were wrong in the same way; the
/// strings here are bytes a client sends, and the assertions are on bytes the server
/// would send back.
///
/// A NON-ASCII FRAME IS PINNED, because the failure it guards is silent. `Content-Length`
/// counts BYTES, and a server that counted characters would understate every frame whose
/// body contains a character outside ASCII -- and this corpus's comments are full of em
/// dashes and curly quotes. The client would then read the next frame starting inside
/// this one. The assertion is a byte count, so it fails the moment that is got wrong.
