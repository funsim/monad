/// HTTP/1.1 server — `moon` mote, Layer 1 (sequential).
///
/// Listens on a port, accepts connections one at a time, parses each
/// request, dispatches to a handler, formats the response, and closes.
/// Concurrency (fiber-per-request) is Phase 7; the sequential server here
/// keeps a connection open between requests and serves a pipelined request
/// out of the bytes the previous read left behind.
///
/// Three API styles:
///
///   Production:  `Server.serve handler port` — infinite accept loop.
///                Never returns. One connection at a time, kept alive.
///
///   Connection:  `Server.serve_connection handler sock carry served` —
///                serve one socket until it must end. This is the loop the
///                accept loop runs, and the one tests exercise directly when
///                they need more than one request on a connection.
///
///   Testing:     `Server.handle_connection handler sock` — read exactly one
///                request, respond, close. Tests interleave client-side writes
///                and reads around this call in the same thread, which only
///                terminates if it stops after the one request.
///
/// Static file serving: `Server.static root` returns a handler that reads
/// files from `root` + request path. No path traversal protection in v1.
///
/// The read timeout is a known gap: a peer that opens a connection and then
/// says nothing holds it until it closes. `Server.max_keep_alive_requests`
/// bounds how many requests one connection may serve, which is a different
/// thing -- it stops a *talking* client from holding the connection forever,
/// not a silent one. A real fix means a socket read deadline, which the IO
/// layer does not expose yet.
