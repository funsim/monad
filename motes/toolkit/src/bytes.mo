/// It is a module of its own rather than a section of one of its two users,
/// because both of them need ALL of it and neither owns it. `framing` needs
/// `\r` and `\n` to find where a header ends; `position` needs `\n` and the
/// two encoding predicates to find where a line ends and how wide a character
/// is. Putting the constants in `framing` would make line splitting depend on
/// the frame reader, which is backwards.
///
/// THE THREE COUNTS A STRING HAS ARE NOT THE SAME COUNT, and that is the fact
/// these predicates exist to keep straight. A character is one code point, but
/// it is one to four BYTES in UTF-8 and one to two UTF-16 CODE UNITS, and it is
/// one COLUMN if you count the way `lang`'s `Location.column` does. Every one
/// of the three is needed by something in this toolkit, and each of the three
/// shortcuts between them is wrong on a different input -- see `position`'s
/// module doc, which is where that gets pinned.
///
/// Every predicate is written with `U8.gt` and a negation rather than with the
/// range's lower bound directly, because `U8.gt` is `pub`
/// (`init/src/number.mo:268`) and `U8.lt` is not. Reaching for the non-`pub`
/// name would draw a `cross_mote_package_private` warning on every check of
/// every consumer, so the bound each predicate really means is spelled out in
/// its doc comment instead of in its code.

/// `position` -- the same byte wearing two hats, which is why it lives here.
