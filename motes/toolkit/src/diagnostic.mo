/// `lang`'s diagnostics as the editor sees them: one line of text, one range,
/// one severity.
///
/// THE MESSAGE HAS TO BE REDUCED, and that is most of why this module exists.
/// `lang`'s `Diagnostic.message` is the RENDERED TERMINAL OUTPUT, not a summary:
/// `render_type_error` produces `error: <what> in <decl>` followed by a `-->`
/// arrow line and, for a parse error, three lines of source with a caret under
/// the offending column. That is exactly right for `monad check`, which prints
/// it to a terminal, and wrong for an editor -- the arrow names a path the
/// editor already knows, the source excerpt duplicates text the editor is
/// displaying a few pixels away, and the caret duplicates the range being sent
/// alongside. So the reduction drops all of it and keeps the header line.
///
/// The reduction lives here rather than in `lang` for the reason `lang`'s own
/// `Diagnostic` doc gives: `check` reads that message, so its rendering cannot
/// move without changing `check`'s output. A consumer that wants a different
/// shape reduces it, and this is that consumer.
///
/// The `error: ` prefix goes too. LSP carries severity as a FIELD, and every
/// client renders it as a gutter glyph or a coloured header, so a message that
/// also begins "error: " reads as a stutter in exactly the place the user is
/// looking. What remains -- `unknown variable 'no_such_name' in bad` -- is the
/// sentence a human wants, and the trailing ` in bad` is kept deliberately even
/// though the range covers that declaration: at declaration granularity the
/// range can be a dozen lines tall, and naming the declaration is what tells the
/// user which one.
///
/// SEVERITY IS ALWAYS `Error`, and that is a statement about `lang` rather than
/// about this module: `lang`'s `Diagnostic` has no severity field, and no
/// producer emits anything but a hard failure. The four constants are here in
/// their specification order so that the first producer of a warning has the
/// numbers to hand and does not invent them; the severity-aware counting in
/// `cli/src/main.mo`'s check loop is the other half of that, already landed.
///
/// THE POSITION AND RANGE ENCODERS ARE NOT HERE. They moved to `toolkit::wire`
/// when hover and definition arrived needing the same shapes. That is the split
/// this module's earlier note asked for: a diagnostics file being their first home
/// was an accident of who needed a range first, not a claim about where the shapes
/// belong.
///
/// What is left is what is about a DIAGNOSTIC: its severity, its
/// source name, and the reduction of `lang`'s rendered terminal output to one line
/// of text. None of those means anything for a jump target or an outline entry.
///
/// The move also took `lang`'s two position types out of this module's imports
/// entirely. `diagnostic_range` still answers an `Option SourceRange`, but the
/// only thing done with one is hand it to `wire_range_of_source_range`, so no
/// `Location` field is read here at all -- and a module that cannot read a field
/// cannot be the next home of the accessors that read it.
