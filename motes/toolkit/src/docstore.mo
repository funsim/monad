/// The open documents: what the client says each file currently contains, and
/// which revision of it that is.
///
/// WHY THE SERVER KEEPS ITS OWN COPY AT ALL is the first thing to be clear
/// about, because it looks like duplication. The client sends the buffer's text
/// with every change; the file on disk lags it by however long the user has gone
/// without saving. A server that read the file instead would diagnose the last
/// SAVED revision while the user looks at an unsaved one, so every squiggle
/// would be one edit behind -- the classic "the error is on the line above where
/// it says" complaint. The store is the buffer, and the disk is only consulted
/// for files no one has opened.
///
/// IT IS KEYED BY URI, NOT BY PATH, and that is the specification's model rather
/// than a convenience. A document's identity to the client is its URI, and the
/// same file reached by two URIs -- a symlink and its target, a path spelled with
/// and without a percent-escape -- is two documents as far as `didOpen` and
/// `didClose` are concerned. Keying by path would merge them and then deliver
/// `didClose` for one to the other. `docstore_path_of_uri` exists for the one
/// direction that must cross over: the checker is handed a PATH, so a URI is
/// turned into one when, and only when, a check runs.
///
/// THE VERSION IS KEPT EVEN THOUGH NOTHING HERE READS IT, because
/// `publishDiagnostics` may carry the version the diagnostics were computed
/// against, and a client that receives a version older than its buffer discards
/// the whole set. That is the correct behaviour -- stale squiggles are worse
/// than none -- but it means a server that reports the WRONG version silently
/// stops showing diagnostics for a file that is being edited. Keeping the number
/// here, next to the text it belongs to, is what makes reporting it correct by
/// construction: they are stored and read together or not at all.
///
/// SYNC IS FULL-TEXT ONLY. `didChange` replaces the whole buffer rather than
/// applying a range edit, which is what the server advertises
/// (`textDocumentSync: 1`) and what the Rust server being replaced does. The
/// `change` and `open` entry points are separate anyway, despite having the same
/// body today, because incremental sync would change exactly one of them -- and
/// the moment a range-edit path exists, a single shared entry point is the thing
/// that would let a `didOpen` be treated as an edit. When that day comes, only
/// `docstore_change` changes.
///
/// THE URI CODE IS PERCENT-AWARE, which is a difference from the tool being
/// replaced: `rust-cli/src/lsp.rs`'s `uri_to_path` strips the `file://` prefix
/// and stops, so a path containing a space or any non-ASCII byte -- both of
/// which this repository's own filenames avoid but which are unremarkable
/// elsewhere -- would be handed to the checker as the literal text `%20` and
/// fail to open. LSP URIs are RFC 3986 URIs, so decoding is not optional.
