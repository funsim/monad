/// Wire framing: turning an accumulated byte stream into whole messages,
/// for both protocols this toolkit's consumers speak.
///
/// LSP frames a message as `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n` followed by exactly
/// N bytes of UTF-8 JSON. MCP frames it as one JSON value per line. The two
/// differ only in where a message ends, which is why they share one outcome
/// type rather than each growing their own reader.
///
/// THE READER IS A PURE FUNCTION OVER AN ACCUMULATED BUFFER, and that is not
/// a stylistic choice -- it is the whole reason this module exists. The
/// natural first implementation is a loop: `read a line`, `parse the headers
/// on it`, `read N more bytes`. It CANNOT survive a read that splits a
/// header. A stream hands back whatever it has, so `read` routinely returns
/// `"Content-Len"` with no newline anywhere in it, and a line-oriented reader
/// has no answer for "the buffer is a strict prefix of a header" -- it must
/// either block (never knowing how much more to ask for) or guess. The guess
/// that looks reasonable, treating the partial line as a whole line, drops a
/// message silently, and the failure shows up one request later as a
/// desynchronized stream that reads like a client bug.
///
/// Making the answer a VALUE removes the guess: `FrameRead.need_more` IS the
/// partial case, so the caller's loop is "append what arrived, ask again",
/// and there is nowhere for a partial frame to be lost. It also makes every
/// one of those cases testable without a socket, which is how the header-split
/// and terminator-inside-a-body tests below are written.
///
/// The second half of the same hazard is a `\r\n\r\n` INSIDE a JSON string
/// body -- entirely legal JSON, and a thing a client does the moment a user
/// types a blank line into a document. `content_length` mode therefore parses
/// the header first and then takes exactly the declared number of bytes; it
/// never searches the buffer for a terminator that a body could also match.
/// A reader that scanned for the terminator instead would split that message
/// in two, which is the same silent desynchronization by another route.
///
/// Case sensitivity of the header name: matched EXACTLY, as
/// `Content-Length:`. The LSP specification fixes that spelling and every
/// mainstream client emits it that way, so case folding would be code with no
/// caller. The choice is safe in the direction that matters -- a differently
/// cased header does not silently mis-parse, it comes back as
/// `FrameRead.bad_header`, which the server reports and logs.
///
/// HOW MUCH MORE TO ASK FOR IS ALSO A VALUE, in `framing_needed`, and it is
/// what keeps the caller's loop from costing a read per byte. The loop still
/// reads "append what arrived, ask again", but the native underneath reads to
/// a REQUESTED LENGTH rather than returning whatever is available, so a caller
/// that always asks for one byte turns a large message into hundreds of
/// syscalls while a caller that always asks for a large chunk blocks until the
/// peer fills it -- which for a request/response protocol is a deadlock.
/// `framing_needed` separates the two cases that the buffer state actually
/// distinguishes: `Option.none` while the header is still incomplete, and the
/// outstanding byte count once `Content-Length` is known, so the read is one
/// byte per header byte and then exactly the body in a single call.
///
/// It NEVER answers zero, and that is a correctness rule rather than a
/// rounding choice: an empty result IS the end-of-stream signal, so requesting
/// zero bytes would be indistinguishable from the peer closing the connection
/// and the caller would exit in the middle of a session. A frame that is
/// already complete therefore reports a floor of one, which the caller
/// re-examines before reading.
