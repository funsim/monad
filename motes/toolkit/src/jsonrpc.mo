/// THE ID IS KEPT AS THE NODE THE CLIENT SENT, never as a parsed number, and
/// that is the one decision in this file that is load-bearing rather than
/// stylistic. A client sends `"id": 1` and matches the response to its request BY
/// THAT VALUE; a server that parsed the id into an `I64` and re-rendered it would
/// eventually emit `1.0` (or `"1"`) for some id and the client would have a
/// response it cannot place -- a hang with no error anywhere, since JSON-RPC has
/// no way to complain about an unmatched id. Carrying the `Json` node and
/// splicing it back out makes that impossible by construction: nothing in the
/// encode path can change a value it never inspects.
///
/// Nothing here is LSP-specific, and nothing here frames: `rpc_encode_*` returns
/// a JSON BODY, and the caller wraps it with `framing`. That split is what lets
/// the same module serve MCP's newline-delimited transport, and it is what makes
/// every test below runnable without a socket.

// What changed is the other side: an EMPTY filter is now a hard ERROR, because a
// `use` line is the complete dependency declaration and a brace item names a
// top-level declaration exactly (`MONAD_USE_COMPLETENESS=error`, the enforced CI
// step). A warning shared with main's own corpus beats an error that fails the
// build, and `lang/src/json.mo:7`'s `{BTreeMap, BTreeMap.to_list, empty}` is the
// spelling to match. The 21 such warnings in this corpus all predate these motes.
