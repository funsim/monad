/// Source positions: `lang`'s coordinates on one side, the LSP wire's on the
/// other, and the three different counts in between.
///
/// THE THREE COUNTS ARE NOT THE SAME COUNT, and every bug this module exists to
/// prevent is a mix-up between them:
///
///   * `lang`'s `Location.offset` is a 0-based BYTE offset into the file.
///   * `lang`'s `Location.column` is 1-based and counts CODE POINTS -- pinned by
///     `test_resolve_offsets_column_counts_characters`
///     (`lang/src/parser/position.mo:623`), where an em dash advances the
///     column by one and the byte offset by three.
///   * LSP's `Position.character` is 0-based and counts whatever the negotiated
///     `positionEncoding` says: UTF-8 code units (which are bytes) for
///     `"utf-8"`, UTF-16 code units for `"utf-16"`.
///
/// So none of the three is derivable from another by arithmetic, and the one
/// that looks cheapest -- `column - 1` -- is correct for ASCII-only text and
/// silently wrong past the first astral character. `wire_of_location` therefore
/// takes `line` and `offset` and NOT `column`, and that omission is the point
/// rather than an oversight: there is no encoding for which `column` is the
/// answer, so accepting it would only invite the mistake.
///
/// The failure mode is worth stating because it is quiet. A position that is
/// off by one code unit puts the editor's cursor on the neighbouring character
/// and its squiggle one column to the left; nothing errors, nothing logs, and
/// the only symptom is that the tool looks slightly careless on exactly the
/// lines a human is most likely to be reading closely. `test_position_*` below
/// pin the two inputs where the cheap answer diverges, one BMP and one astral.
///
/// THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT `lang`. It works on plain `I64`
