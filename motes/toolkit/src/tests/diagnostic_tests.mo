/// Diagnostic tests: the message reduction, the range, and the exact bytes.
///
/// THE MESSAGE FIXTURES ARE VERBATIM, not paraphrased, and that matters more
/// than it looks. The reduction's whole job is to cut `lang`'s rendered
/// terminal output down to its header line, so a fixture invented from the
/// shape of the renderer would test the fixture rather than the renderer's
/// actual output. Both strings below were read off a real run (the type error
/// from `lang/src/tests/unify_tests.mo`'s "type mismatch" case, the parse error
/// from `lang/src/tests/decl_range_tests.mo`, printed through `cat -A` so the
/// caret alignment is copied rather than guessed); the only edit is the path,
/// replaced with a fixed one because the real path carries a pid and a shared
/// `/tmp` name collides across sharded runs.
///
/// The two are different SHAPES, which is the reason to have both: a type error
/// renders as header plus a `-->` arrow and stops, while a parse error renders
/// header, arrow, and then two lines of source with a caret under the offending
/// column. A reduction that cut at a fixed byte count, or that assumed the arrow
/// was the last line, would pass on one of these and fail on the other. Note
/// also that the parse fixture's second context line is EMPTY (`  2 | `) -- a
/// trailing-space line, so a reduction that trimmed whitespace per line would
/// still pass but a fixture written without the space would not be the real
/// output.
///
/// THE JSON ASSERTIONS ARE EXACT STRINGS, which is the only way to pin the
/// things that matter on the wire: that `BTreeMap` sorts keys alphabetically
/// (`message`, `range`, `severity`, `source`), that a range nests `start`/`end`
/// with `character` before `line`, and that no separators are invented. Every
/// expected string here was OBSERVED from a run before being written down; the
/// first draft of two of them was wrong by hand and the failure output is what
/// corrected them.
///
/// Field reads go through typed accessor defs (`dt_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `dt_` prefix is collision-avoiding because whole-program scope is
/// shared with every other mote's tests, and `position_tests.mo` already holds
/// `pt_`.
