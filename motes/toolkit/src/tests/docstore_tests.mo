/// THE URI SECTION IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST, and it is where the tool being
/// replaced is wrong rather than merely different. Every expectation below that
/// involves an escape was computed by hand from RFC 3986 and then checked against
/// a run -- `%20` is a space, `%2F` is a slash, `+` is NOT a space (that is the
/// `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` rule, a different encoding that shares the
/// `%` syntax), and `%C3%A9` is the two UTF-8 bytes of `é`. A server that got any
/// of those wrong would work perfectly on every path in this repository and fail
/// on the first user path with a space in it, which is the kind of bug that is
/// only ever found by a user.
///
/// The store tests are lifecycle-shaped because that is all the store has: the
/// interesting cases are all "the client said something twice" or "the client
/// said something out of order", which is what a long-lived server sees and a
/// single-shot tool never does.
///
/// Field reads go through typed accessor defs (`dc_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `dc_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared
/// with every other mote's tests.
