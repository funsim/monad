/// Framing tests: the two cases that fail silently if they are wrong.
///
/// A framing bug does not announce itself. A reader that mishandles a split
/// header drops a message and produces a stream that desynchronizes one
/// request later, which reads as a client bug; a reader that searches for the
/// terminator instead of honouring `Content-Length` splits the first body
/// containing a blank line, which reads as a garbled request. Both leave the
/// server answering, so both cost an afternoon of looking at the wrong end of
/// the pipe. They are pinned here instead.
///
/// Everything is written against the pure reader (`framing_read`), so no
/// socket and no stdio native is involved -- which is the whole reason the
/// framing logic is a function over a buffer rather than a loop over a
/// descriptor.
///
/// Helper names carry an `fr_` prefix. The whole-program scope is shared with
/// every other mote's tests, and this repo has a documented history of two
/// same-named defs silently colliding with the failure flipping on load
/// order; `one_body_is`/`nth` would be exactly the kind of generic name that
/// collides next time a tool mote adds a test helper.
