/// EVERY EXPECTATION BELOW IS AN OFFSET THAT WAS COUNTED BY HAND over a fixture
/// whose bytes are written out in the comment beside it, and the counting is the
/// point rather than a chore. The scan's rule -- the byte at the offset, or the
/// byte before it -- reads as if it must be off by one somewhere, and the two
/// places it could be are both here as tests: a cursor just past an identifier's
/// last byte, which must find it, and a cursor on the first space of an indented
/// line, which must find NOTHING rather than the identifier that ended the line
/// above. Those two pull in opposite directions, so a version that gets one right
/// by luck is very likely to get the other wrong.
///
/// The consequence tests are here for the same reason and are marked as such:
/// `.` being an identifier byte means `I64.add` is one run and `café` ends at the
/// `é`. Neither is a bug being pinned -- both are the reference's character set
/// and both resolve to nothing, which is the honest answer for a cursor that is
/// not on a name -- but a later reader who finds them odd should find the
/// reasoning next to the assertion rather than have to rederive it.
///
/// Field reads go through the typed accessor defs below (`tt_*`), never inline in
/// a `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `tt_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared
