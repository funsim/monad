/// The wire shapes for a range and a location: what a jump target and an outline
/// entry are made of.
///
/// THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE TWO FEATURES NOW READ THE SAME CONVERSION. The
/// diagnostic tests pin what a squiggle looks like on the wire, and they do it
/// through `wire_diagnostic_of_lang`, which is a diagnostic's whole path. The
/// conversion underneath it -- `lang`'s two `Location`s to a `WireRange` -- is now
/// read directly by definition, by `documentSymbol` and by hover's cursor range,
/// and none of those takes the diagnostic path. So the conversion is pinned here
/// on its own, at the four places its own contract has edges: an ordinary
/// declaration, a point range, a non-ASCII line, and a range that CANNOT be
/// placed.
///
/// THE UNPLACEABLE RANGE IS THE CASE WORTH THE FILE. `wire_range_of_source_range`
/// answers an `Option`, and a diagnostic and a jump target disagree about what to
/// do with the absence -- the diagnostic reports at the origin, because a broken
/// file shown as clean is worse than a marker in the wrong place, while a jump to
/// the origin is a lie the user will follow. So the absence is a value here rather
/// than something each caller decides by inspecting a range, and the test pins
/// that the absence is REACHABLE rather than asserting a branch no input takes.
///
/// EXPECTED WIRE TEXT IS AN EXACT STRING. The shapes are the specification's, its
/// objects are unordered, and `Json.to_string` walks a `BTreeMap` -- so the keys
/// come out sorted (`end` before `start`, `character` before `line`, `range`
/// before `uri`). Writing the expected string in the order the fields are
/// CONSTRUCTED would fail, and that is the point of asserting text: a client
/// parses by key, so key order is a wire detail, but a test that compared
/// something looser would not notice a missing field or an invented separator.
///
/// Field reads go through typed accessor defs (`wt_*`), never inline in a
/// `#[test]` def, per this repo's recorded `#[test]` plus struct-field codegen
/// hazard. The `wt_` prefix is collision-avoiding: whole-program scope is shared
/// with every other mote's tests.
