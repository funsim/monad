/// What is under the cursor: the identifier that a hover, a definition jump or a
/// reference search is about.
///
/// THIS IS THE HALF OF THE REFERENCE'S `identifier_at` THAT IS WORTH KEEPING.
/// `rust-cli/src/main.rs:712-736` does two things: it scans the line the cursor
/// is on for the run of identifier characters around a column, and then it
/// resolves the resulting NAME against a symbol table. The scan is right and the
/// resolution is not -- its own doc records that a local shadowing a top-level
/// def resolves to the top-level one, and that an ambiguous cross-mote name
/// resolves to whichever file a scan happens to reach first. This module is the
/// scan and only the scan: it answers WHICH BYTES the cursor is on, and the
/// `motes/lsp` engine resolves the name against the warm scope, where the
/// shadowing answer exists because the scope has a parent chain. Keeping the two
/// apart is what lets the second half be fixed without touching the first.
///
/// THE WORKING UNIT IS A BYTE OFFSET, NOT A LINE AND COLUMN, and that is a
/// deliberate departure. The checker reports byte offsets, the span table is
/// built in byte offsets, and `toolkit::position`'s `offset_of_wire` already
/// converts a wire position into one. A scan taking a line and a character would
/// need its own conversion back into the same units, and two conversions of one
/// position that disagree -- one counting UTF-16 code units, one counting
/// characters -- is exactly the class of bug this mote exists to not have. There
/// is no conversion here. The caller converts once.
///
/// A RUN CANNOT CROSS A LINE, because `\n` and `\r` are not identifier
/// characters. So the scan needs no line index and no line bound -- and that is
/// not an incidental simplification but what makes the step-back-one-byte rule in
/// `text_identifier_at` safe. Its doc has the argument.
///
/// THE CHARACTER SET IS THE REFERENCE'S, verbatim: ASCII alphanumeric, `_`, `.`
/// and `'`. Each of the four is load-bearing:
///
///  - `_` and the digits are how a great many names are spelled.
///  - `.` makes a qualified name -- `Json.parse`, `p.first`, `U8.gt` -- a single
///    run, because a cursor on any part of one is a question about the whole
///    qualified name. Splitting it into a module part and a name part is the
///    resolver's job, since only the resolver knows which modules are in scope.
///  - `'` allows a primed name, and it also means a character literal reads as
///    one run. The reference does the same, and it costs nothing: `'a'` resolves
///    as a name and fails to resolve, so hover shows nothing, which is the honest
///    answer for a cursor on a literal.
///
/// The set is ASCII-only on purpose. A non-ASCII byte -- a lead byte or a
/// continuation byte of any UTF-8 character -- is not an identifier byte, so an
/// identifier ENDS at the first one. Monad identifiers are ASCII, so a
/// non-ASCII byte inside one means the cursor is in a comment or a string, where
/// there is nothing to resolve. The useful consequence runs the other way:
/// every offset this module returns is an ASCII byte offset, hence a character
/// boundary, which is what makes slicing the span back out of the source safe
/// with no further check.

/// A half-open byte range `[start, stop)` into one source string.
///
/// Half-open rather than inclusive so that `stop - start` is the length and an
/// empty span is expressible, which matters upstream: an LSP range's two ends are
/// positions, and a caller that wants a one-character range around a point can
/// say so without a special case.

/// of the byte AFTER it -- the position that follows the word, which is also
/// where a client sends the cursor when the user has just typed it. Testing only
/// the byte at the offset would answer nothing for that single most common
/// gesture there is, so when the byte at the offset is not an identifier byte,
/// the byte BEFORE it is what the scan anchors on.
///
/// THE STEP BACK CANNOT SHADOW A CORRECT ANSWER, which is why it is safe. It is
/// taken only when the byte at the offset is not an identifier byte, and then the
/// offset is not inside any identifier -- there is no run it could belong to --
/// so the preceding identifier is the only one the cursor could plausibly mean.
/// A cursor ON an identifier character, which is where an editor that positions
/// its cursor on a character puts it, is decided by the byte at the offset and
/// never reaches this rule at all.
///
/// IT CANNOT WALK ONTO THE PREVIOUS LINE, which is the case a rule like this
/// gets wrong and so is worth stating rather than assuming. A cursor on an
/// indented line's first space arrives with the byte before it being that line's
/// `\n`, and `\n` is not an identifier byte, so the rule declines: the answer is
/// nothing, not the last identifier of the line above. The general statement is
/// the same one that bounds a run -- the terminator is not an identifier byte, so
/// no test for one can step over it -- and the `text_run_covers` doc makes the
/// same point from the other side.
///
/// An offset past the end of the source is treated as its predecessor, the same
/// rule as above; an offset before the start answers nothing. Callers get an
/// offset from `offset_of_wire`, which clamps, so neither is reachable in
/// practice -- they are total anyway, because a cursor position is client input
/// and a server that crashes on out-of-range input is a server that crashes.

/// is a test `text_run_covers` already has to make.
///
/// A run is answered the moment it ends, and the first run that covers the offset
/// is the answer: a later run starts after this one stops, so it cannot cover an
