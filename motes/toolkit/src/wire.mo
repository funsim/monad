/// The specification's position, range and location shapes, and the one place
/// `lang`'s coordinates become them.
///
/// THIS MODULE EXISTS BECAUSE A SECOND CONSUMER ARRIVED. `diagnostic.mo` carried
/// the two encoders with a note saying so: `position.mo` is deliberately free of
/// `lang` and of `Json`, and diagnostics were the first thing that needed a range
/// on the wire, so the shapes landed beside them -- with an explicit instruction
/// to split them out "when hover and definition arrive with their own need for
/// the same shapes". They have. Hover needs a range, definition needs a
/// `Location`, and `documentSymbol` needs one of each per declaration, so the
/// shapes moved here rather than being copied into `motes/lsp` a third time, and
/// `diagnostic.mo` now imports them like any other consumer.
///
/// WHAT IS LEFT IN `diagnostic.mo` IS WHAT IS ABOUT A DIAGNOSTIC: its severity,
/// its source name, and the reduction of `lang`'s rendered terminal output to one
/// line of text. What is here is the geometry, which is the same for a squiggle, a
/// jump target and an outline entry.
///
/// THE FOUR `lang` ACCESSORS ARE DUPLICATED FROM `diagnostic.mo`, and deliberately
/// not shared with it: they exist because `lang`'s `Location` and `SourceRange`
/// have no accessors of their own, and this repository's `#[test]`-plus-field-read
/// codegen hazard means a field read is wrapped in a one-line typed def rather
/// than written inline. Since the move leaves `diagnostic.mo` with no `lang` types
/// in it at all, the copies here are the only ones -- the duplication the split
/// removes is a module boundary, not a second spelling of the same four lines,
/// and a `wire_*` prefix is what keeps them out of the way of the rest of
/// whole-program scope.
