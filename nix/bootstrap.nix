# The fixpoint, asserted rather than remembered. A compiler that builds and
# checks but emits different IR for its own source once it is itself compiled
# is a miscompile the front-end tests cannot see, and it is exactly the
# property that would regress silently.
#
#   monad2.ll -- what the PACKAGED compiler emits for cli/src/main.mo
#   monad3.ll -- what the binary built FROM that IR emits, for the same source
#
# so the `cmp` says the compiler the flake ships is at a fixpoint: one more turn
# of self-compilation changes nothing. Both turns are
# `scripts/self-compile-turn.sh` -- the same step, with the same absolute `-o`,
# that CI's bootstrap-compile.sh performs on a binary it has just built.
#
# The ladder's FIRST comparison -- rung 1, the IR the host INTERPRETER emits for
# this same source (`monad-rs run`, the buildPhase in nix/monad.nix; the host
# never compiles it), against rung 2 -- needs a file this derivation is not
# given and deliberately does not ship: nix/monad.nix's installPhase says why
# the `.ll` is not installed. `scripts/bootstrap-compile.sh` builds both of its
# turns in one directory and asserts that comparison on every push, in both
# build modes. Saying so here rather than approximating it is the point.
#
# Cost, and why it is not a CI job: rung 1 here is `packages.monad`, so this
# check only pays that ~20 minute build when it is not already in the store --
# but the check itself is a `check` plus two self-compiles. CI's ladder pays
# the same interpretation on every compiler change, and in a different
# derivation (its own scratch directory, not `packages.monadRung1`), so that is
# the same work and not the same store path: gating a pipeline on this would add
# a third ~20 minute interpretation rather than reusing one.
