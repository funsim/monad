# Rung 1, in two derivations: the host interprets `cli/src/main.mo` into a real
# `monad` plus the `.ll` it emitted (`packages.monadRung1`), and a small link
# step stamps that `.ll` with this commit's revision (`packages.monad`).
#
# The split exists because of what made the old single derivation uncacheable.
# `.#monad` was cold on EVERY commit for two independent reasons -- its `src`
# was `../.`, the whole tree, and `MONAD_BUILD_COMMIT` was interpolated into
# its phases -- so the 20-minute interpretation was paid again by every commit,
# including one that changed only a workflow file. The revision has to be baked
# in (see installPhase), so the second reason cannot be removed from the
# arithmetic. What CAN be removed is the interpretation: the revision never
# enters the emitted IR, so the expensive half is a pure function of the
# compiler's sources, and the per-commit half is a three-command link.
#
# That the revision does not reach the IR is measured, not assumed. Two rung-1
# builds of the same source stamped with two DIFFERENT revisions (5441725 and
# 6770f64) emitted byte-identical `monad.ll` -- `cmp` clean on 5417399 bytes --
# which is what makes a commit-free `rung1` a legitimate input to a stamped
# `.#monad`. `monad_build_commit` reaches the binary as a `declare` the runtime
# object defines (`llvm/src/link.mo`'s `build_commit_define`, and
# runtime/src/runtime.c's `#ifdef MONAD_BUILD_COMMIT`), which is why the define
# has to be applied by a LINK and not by a wrapper.
#
# `.#monad` is what `packages.default` and `apps.monad` point to, so
# `nix build .#monad` and `nix run .#monad` are unchanged. It is a
# build-and-check artifact rather than a distributable one, and the reason is
# now only that this derivation installs the BINARY and not the sources: the
# compiler finds `init`/`std`/`llvm`/`runtime` in the target mote's declared
# `[dependencies.X] path` entries, in an installed toolchain root
# (`$MONAD_ROOT`, else `$MONAD_HOME` + `active`) or by walking up from the
# working directory to a workspace root (`resolve_runtime_src`,
# `lang/src/module.mo`). The nightly artifact is the distributable half
# precisely because `scripts/stage-mote-sources.sh` also ships the four motes
# beside the binary; a store copy of this derivation has no such directory to
# point at and cannot name one (see MONAD_BUILD_COMMIT below for the same
# "a store copy cannot name itself" constraint). Bare, then, a packaged
# `monad build` runs from a checkout, exactly as CI runs it.
#
# The step that builds rung 1 is `scripts/build-self-hosted.sh`, not a shell
# command spelled out here: CI builds rung 1 through that same script in
# check-monad-tests.sh, bootstrap-compile.sh and debug-oracle.sh, and the two
# drifted apart once already (the absolute `-o`, commit b8af914). The host
# arrives as a built input rather than as the script's default `cargo run`,
# which is what MONAD_HOST_BIN is for. The stack raise, and the note that says
# what the limit actually came out as, are the script's too -- a nix sandbox
# cannot raise RLIMIT_STACK (soft == hard), so rung 1 runs here with less
# stack than CI gives it, and it completes anyway.

      # A1 -- WHAT THE BUILD READS, which is what a derivation's hash should
      # cover and what `src = ../.` did not.
      #
      # `scripts/build-self-hosted.sh`'s staleness scan is the authoritative
      # input list and is the guide here: the trees the compiler is built from,
      # their `.mo`/`.c`/`.h` sources and each one's `mote.toml`. That is the
      # complete set for those trees -- enumerated rather than assumed: they
      # hold 188 `.mo`, 13 `mote.toml` and exactly one `.c`
      # (runtime/src/runtime.c), and no file of any other name. `.h` is in the
      # filter and matches nothing today; it is there because the script scans
      # for it, and a header added later must not silently fall outside the
      # hash that is supposed to cover it.
      #
      # THE RULE, because this list has been wrong twice: every mote the
      # compiler's own sources IMPORT is a compiler input. `cli/mote.toml`
      # declares `[dependencies.lsp]` and `cli/src/main.mo` has
      # `use lsp::server`, so rung 1 -- which compiles `cli/src/main.mo` --
      # needs `motes/lsp`, and `motes/lsp` needs `motes/toolkit` (its own
      # `[dependencies]`) and `motes/json` (`use json::json`). Adding a mote to
      # `cli/mote.toml` without adding it here fails the buildPhase with
      # `module not found: <mote>.<module>`: the import that could not resolve,
      # never the missing input that caused it. (Measured both ways on a tree
      # assembled by exactly this filter: without a mote it is exactly that
      # error -- most recently `json`, which `6424aacb` moved out of `lang` and
      # added only as `toml` -- and with them `1 file(s) checked, 0 error(s)`.)
      #
      # Three things outside the scan are kept because the build needs them:
      #
      #   * the root `mote.toml`. Its `[workspace] members` names trees this
      #     filter drops (`bench`, `proofs`, `slow_tests`, and the motes that
      #     are not compiler inputs), and the fear was that the memberlist is
      #     walked eagerly and their absence would break the load. It is not:
      #     the compiler's own source checks clean in a tree assembled by
      #     exactly this filter with those trees absent. The file stays because
      #     it is the workspace-root marker `resolve_runtime_src` walks up to
      #     find, and losing that is a different failure from losing a member.
      #   * `scripts/build-self-hosted.sh`, the one script buildPhase enters,
      #     and `scripts/lib` beside it, which is where that script's helpers
      #     live (`lib/raise-stack.sh`, sourced at its line 55). A `source`d
      #     file is invisible to the extension filter above, and omitting it is
      #     how commit 22b4e287 came to break this derivation: rung 1 died at
      #     that line with `No such file or directory`. The rest of `scripts/`
      #     stays out, so a CI script's edit still does not invalidate a
      #     20-minute build.
      #   * `nix/` is NOT kept, and neither are the flake files: nothing in the
      #     build reads them. The revision and the version reach this
      #     derivation as `commit` and `monadVersion` arguments, and the
      #     toolchain reaches it through `pkgs`.
      #
      # 205 files and 4.7 MiB, against the whole tracked tree's 476 files and
      # 8.1 MiB (both measured -- re-measure rather than adjust these, they
      # have gone stale three times). What that buys is not a smaller build --
      # it is a SHAREABLE one: `rung1` below carries no commit, so this hash is
      # the same across two commits that differ only outside these paths, and
      # that is the prerequisite for two CI runs ever sharing the result.
