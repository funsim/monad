# The self-hosted compiler compiles ITSELF, and then the binary that falls
# out has to do the job it was built for.
#
# The second step is the one with teeth. `compile` succeeding only says
# llc and clang were happy with the emitted IR; it says nothing about
# whether the binary works, and a compiler that builds but miscompiles
# is worse than one that fails to build. Running `check cli/src/main.mo`
# through it costs ~12s and exercises the whole front end -- parser,
# scope, elaboration, typechecker -- on the largest input in the tree.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT check is the fixpoint: that the `.ll`
# this binary produces from the same source is byte-identical to the one
# the host produced (it is, and all three stages agree bit-for-bit), and
# that the same holds one more turn out. That is the stronger property
# and the one that would regress silently, but it costs another full
# self-compile per turn. It got cheap enough (2026-09-19): the self-hosted
# compile is ~40s interpreted against ~320s when this was written, so both
# modes below now cmp their second turn. The `ulimit -s` is load-bearing for
# exactly the turn this adds -- the second turn is the binary interpreting
# ITSELF, which is where the ladder's own rung-2 first hit the default 8MB
# stack (`|| true` keeps a runner whose HARD limit is lower at its own
# ceiling rather than failing the job).
#
# This is called by .github/workflows/ci.yml and .tangled/workflows/bootstrap.yml
# directly, inside one `nix develop -c`, rather than through
# `devenv tasks run monad:bootstrap-compile` (which is the local equivalent):
# devenv-tasks captures a task's stdout and shows it only when the task FAILS,
# which would swallow the --verbose per-module and per-stage trace below -- the
# evidence that says where a wedged or miscompiling run actually stalled. The
# task in devenv.nix runs this same script in this same dev shell, just quieter
# on success.
#
# Commands run bare in a `run:` get the RUNNER HOST's PATH, not the dev shell's,
# so a tool is only a declared dependency when it comes through `nix develop`.
# That is why the whole pipeline lives here rather than in the workflow YAML.

# No timeout, by design: the interpreted self-compile measured ~320s
# (2026-09-09) but stretches 2-4x when the runner's other jobs and local
# sessions share this machine. A fixed `timeout` here was killing healthy
# runs; the job-level `timeout-minutes` is the hang guard. Progress is
# visible instead: --verbose streams a per-module and per-stage trace
# (std/src/log.mo), so a genuinely wedged run shows exactly which stage
# stalled.
#
# The interpreter the two builds below run is the job's `MONAD_HOST_BIN`,
# which CI's `bootstrap` job sets to the flake's packaged host
# (`nix build .#monadHost`); unset, scripts/build-self-hosted.sh falls back to
# `cargo run --release --`, whose cold fat-LTO build was ~10 minutes here
# (actions/checkout runs git clean -ffdx at the start of every job, wiping
# both target directories, .devenv/ and the config, so it was cold every time).
#
# RUNG 1 ITSELF IS NOW ALSO AVAILABLE AS A PACKAGE, and the release ladder
# takes it when this machine's store already holds it -- see the block above
# `ladder()`. That reverses what stood here, which was that a store compiler
# "has no `.ll` beside it (nix/monad.nix does not install one)": `nix/monad.nix`
# now splits rung 1 into `packages.monadRung1`, and that output DOES install the
# `.ll` the interpreter wrote, precisely so this comparison can be made against
# a re-used rung 1 rather than only a re-built one. CI's `test` job has no such
# comparison to make, so it sweeps the packaged compiler -- see its step.
#
# --release: debug info is on by default; DWARF emission costs ~30s on this
# workload and the binary this job tests does not need it. So the release
# ladder is the fast one and the default-mode ladder is the one that gates
# DWARF emission -- and, because both are asserted, the mode flag is threaded
# through every command below rather than set on one of them.
#
# One ladder, both modes: build rung 1, check the largest input in the tree
# through it, then assert the FIXPOINT -- the binary just built compiles the
# same source itself, and the `.ll` it emits (written beside its own `-o`
# output) must be byte-identical to the host's. Rung 1 == rung 2, asserted
# rather than remembered. A binary that builds and checks but emits different
# IR for its own source is a miscompile the front-end tests cannot see.
#
# The turn itself is scripts/self-compile-turn.sh -- the same command, with
# the same absolute `-o` and the same post-condition, that the flake's
# `checks.bootstrap` runs against the packaged compiler. One definition, so
# the two ladders cannot drift.
#
# The only difference between the two callers is `--release` (see each one's
# note below), and it is threaded through to BOTH commands: `--release` on the
# compile is what decides whether DWARF is emitted, and `--release` on the turn
# is what keeps the emitted IR comparable to it. `rm -rf` forces a
# from-scratch build rather than trusting a stale binary; the staleness check
# and the build command live in scripts/build-self-hosted.sh.
#
# A3 -- rung 1 is a package, and the release ladder takes it from the store
# when the store already holds it.
#
# `nix/monad.nix`'s `packages.monadRung1` IS this ladder's rung 1: the host
# interpreting the compiler's own sources, with the `.ll` it emitted installed
# beside the binary. The from-source build below computes exactly that, so when
# the store already has it the build adds nothing but the wait -- and the `.ll`
# it would have written is the very file `cmp` below is a comparison against.
#
# THREE THINGS BOUND IT, all measured rather than assumed:
#
#   * It is RELEASE-ONLY. The two ladder modes' IR differs decisively -- measured
#     on this tree: the release `.ll` is 5510916 bytes and the DWARF mode's
#     8947320, differing from byte 229476 -- so one stored rung 1 cannot serve
#     both, and the debug ladder keeps its from-source build. The step's wall is
#     the SLOWER ladder, and the ladder that sets it is the one that cannot
#     consume this. The saving is therefore runner CPU on the release ladder, NOT
#     the step's wall clock; said plainly here so a CI log is not read as a win it
#     cannot make.
#   * A hit is OPPORTUNISTIC. The fleet's two runners share no nix store, and
#     `ci.yml:62-71` already records that. It hits on a re-run, on a commit that
#     leaves the compiler's sources alone, or when the `test` job landed on this
#     machine -- and `test` builds `.#monad`, which DEPENDS on `rung1`, so a
#     machine that has swept already has this.
#   * `nix-store --check-validity` asks "is it already realized", which is the
#     question. `nix build` would answer it by BUILDING, which is the ~320 s of
#     interpretation this exists to avoid; `nix eval` of the output path carries
#     no such risk, since it evaluates the derivation without realizing it.
#
# The path is content-addressed on the compiler's SOURCES and not on the commit
# (that being the split `nix/monad.nix` performs), so it cannot be a stale hit:
# a dirty or moved source tree evaluates to a different path and the from-source
# build runs. Nothing here asserts anything about the binary's revision -- the
# ladder never checked one, and `cmp` below is what it checks.
