#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Type-check every Monad code block in the mdBook under docs/.
#
# `mdbook build` only renders markdown -- it never compiles the code inside
# the chapters, which is how the book drifted far enough from the compiler
# that most of its samples stopped parsing. This script closes that gap.
#
# A fenced block tagged ```monad is extracted to its own .mo file and run
# through `check`. A block tagged ```monad,ignore is skipped: that tag is
# for samples that are deliberately not valid today -- syntax the docs
# describe as unimplemented, or fragments shown for illustration -- and
# every one of them should have prose next to it saying so.
#
# WHICH FILES, AND WHICH DEFAULT
#
#   docs/src/*.md   OPT-OUT. ```monad is checked, ```monad,ignore skips.
#                   The chapters are mostly runnable samples, so checking
#                   is the right default.
#
#   AGENTS.md       OPT-IN. ```monad is SKIPPED, ```monad,check asks for it.
#                   AGENTS.md is prose written for contributors and agents,
#                   and most of its fences are FRAGMENTS that cannot be a
#                   file at all: bare expressions, a literal `...`, blocks
#                   whose own next line says they are invalid, blocks that
#                   redefine a prelude name. Compiling them all is not
#                   possible, and mass-tagging them `monad,ignore` would
#                   break the rule above -- an ignore tag means "there is
#                   prose here saying why this is not valid", and for a
#                   fragment there is nothing to say.
#
#   README.md       OPT-IN, same tags as AGENTS.md. The landing page is
#                   prose about installing and invoking the compiler; the
#                   quick start's program is the one fence making a claim a
#                   reader copies, so it is the one tagged ```monad,check.
#
# So AGENTS.md is opt-in, and the fences worth checking are the ones that
# make a CLAIM a reader would copy: a `use` line, a declaration form, a
# complete example. That is the class that has actually been wrong here --
# AGENTS.md carried a `use` spelling neither compiler accepts, for months,
# while every gate was green (this script never opened the file).
#
# ```monad,check is honoured in docs/src too, so a chapter can opt a
# fragment in for the same reason.
#
# MUST_CHECK pins the opt-in files. Their default is `skip`, so losing the
# `,check` suffix -- or reshaping the block so the extractor stops seeing it,
# which is how README.md's program hid inside a ```bash heredoc for its whole
# life -- would otherwise drop the file silently and stay green. The pin
# demands at least one checked block from each, because for an opt-in file an
# absent tag is an unchecked claim rather than a deliberate omission.
#
# Blocks are checked in isolation, so each ```monad block must stand on its
# own: its own `use`/`open` lines, its own type annotations. That is a
# feature, not a limitation -- a reader copying one block into a file gets
# exactly what the checker saw.
#
# Two modes. The default uses the Rust bootstrap host, which is fast and is
# what the pre-commit hook runs:
#
#   scripts/check-docs.sh
#
# The book documents the SELF-HOSTED compiler, though, so the stricter check is
# to point MONAD_BIN at a bootstrapped `monad` binary:
#
#   MONAD_BIN=/path/to/monad scripts/check-docs.sh
#
# Both binaries take the same `check <paths>...` shape and the same exit codes,
# so no other change is needed. The self-hosted run is expected to be GREEN:
# every construct this header used to tolerate a failure for -- `#[derive]`, a
# `\u{...}` escape, a dotted instance name, a call relying on a brace
# parameter's default -- now checks self-hosted. Measured 2026-09-23 with a
# binary built from the tree: 114 block(s) checked, 0 error(s). Anything it
# reports is therefore a real problem, and docs/src/bootstrap-host.md is where
# the differences that remain between the two compilers are recorded.
#
# The reverse also exists, which is why a few blocks are tagged
# ```monad,ignore even though they are correct: a multiplicity prefix on a
# destructured parameter parses self-hosted and is a parse error on the host.
#
# Module resolution is relative to the working directory, so this must run
# from the repository root (it cd's there itself).
