# Does a mote in its OWN repository build with the compiler alone?
#
# Every other check in this repo runs from the repository root, where the
# stdlib is `init/src` and `std/src` beside the working directory and the C
# runtime is at `runtime/src/runtime.c` -- all three resolved by CWD-relative
# literals. That is exactly the environment an external mote does not have,
# and it is why this whole class of bug survived: nothing in the repo ever
# ran the CLI from a directory that was not the checkout. The Forge game
# engine, built as a sibling repository, found five such gaps at once.
#
# So this script builds a mote in a temporary directory *outside* the
# checkout and runs the compiled self-hosted binary from inside it, in the
# seven configurations an external user can be in:
#
#   1. declared path dependencies, explicit path -- `monad check src/lib.mo`.
#      The filed repro: everything resolves except `runtime.c`, which had no
#      manifest fallback at all, so `test`/`compile` died at the link stage.
#   2. the same repository, invoked bare -- `cd repo && monad check`, which
#      sets the mote's own directory to `"."` and turns every absolute
#      `[dependencies.X] path` into `"./<abs>"` through a naive join.
#   3. NO path dependencies, an installed toolchain -- `MONAD_ROOT=<root>`,
#      where the root holds `init/`, `std/`, `llvm/` and `runtime/` copied from
#      this checkout. Nothing is declared and nothing is relative: this is the
#      acceptance test for "a mote in its own repo compiles with a
#      monadup-installed toolchain".
#   4. NO path dependencies, the REAL monadup layout -- `MONAD_HOME=<home>`
#      with `active` naming a tag and the toolchain in `downloads/<tag>/`.
#      Configuration 3 only ever exercised `$MONAD_ROOT`, which is the
#      variable a test sets and not the one an install writes: everything a
#      real `monadup install` produces, `active` and the downloads directory
#      included, was covered by unit rows alone until this configuration.
#   5. Nothing at all -- no `$MONAD_ROOT`, no `$MONAD_HOME`, no installed
#      toolchain. This is a first-time user's machine, and what it asserts is
#      that the two things they meet are LEGIBLE: the `monad check` that
#      covers nothing says why and exits non-zero (rather than printing help
#      and exiting 0), and a check that cannot find the ambient motes names
#      `monadup`, `MONAD_ROOT` and `MONAD_HOME` instead of only reporting the
#      modules it could not resolve.
#   6. A real dependency that the manifest forgot to declare -- in both
#      layouts it can sit in. The hint has to name a `path` relative to the
#      MANIFEST, so `foo` and `../foo` are different answers to the same
#      error, and only one of them was right under the hardcoded `../<head>`
#      this replaced. Each layout ends by writing the hint's own path into the
#      manifest and asserting the check goes green.
#   7. A mote naming no target that exists -- no `src/lib.mo`, no
#      `src/main.mo`, and no `[lib]`/`[[bin]]` saying otherwise. Configuration
#      6 asserts the DECLARED-dependency gate; this asserts its sibling target
#      gate. It is also the one configuration with no `[workspace]` anywhere
#      above it: an external mote is a workspace of one, so the member half of
#      that gate has nothing to say and the loaded-module half is the only
#      thing that can report it. Ends by creating the file the error named.
#
# Configuration 3 also compiles and RUNS a binary, which is the only
# assertion that covers the C runtime end to end: the program prints through
# `println`, so a build that never found `runtime.c` cannot produce it.
# Configuration 4 does the same through the `MONAD_HOME` route, because the
# two routes reach the same root by different paths and only one of them was
# ever compiled against.
#
# Takes the compiled binary as its first argument (or `MONAD_BIN`). It must
# be the self-hosted compiler, not the Rust host: `monad-rs` resolves its own
# modules relative to the checkout and cannot be pointed at a foreign CWD.
#
# Run it directly (`scripts/check-external-mote.sh <binary>`); it needs
# `llc`, `clang` and the Boehm GC headers, i.e. the dev shell.

# Both cached verbs below run with the cache OFF, and that is what they are
# for rather than a precaution. Configurations 3 and 4 build the SAME
# fixture, from the SAME directory, through two toolchain roots that are
# `cp -R` copies of each other -- differing only in which variable names the
# root. That is not an input to a key, and should not be: identical bytes
# are identical work. So the two configurations key identically and the
# second replays the first. Measured, one shared store: config 3's `check`
# writes two entries and config 4's `check` adds none, because it is reading
# those two. What config 4 exists to establish is that the `$MONAD_HOME` +
# `active` route RESOLVES, and a replay resolves nothing -- a gate leaning
# on the cache is a gate that goes quiet when the cache gets correct.
#
# `MONAD_NO_CACHE=1` is off in both directions (nothing read, nothing
# written), so what runs here is the resolution it claims to be. Config 3
# keeps the cache on deliberately: it is the configuration whose entries are
# being shared, and it is the one that has to miss for the sharing to be
# observable at all. The build below was masked by a separate defect until
# now -- a mote whose manifest sits in the working directory keyed on an
# empty root, which the shell could not `cd` into, so the builder silently
# disabled its own cache and config 4 compiled for real. Fixing that is what
# makes this line load-bearing.
#
# And "load-bearing" is measured rather than argued: with the root fix in,
# one shared store gives config 3 a missing build (one key) and config 4 a
# `cached:' hit with no key of its own, for byte-identical binaries -- which
# is precisely the replay this hatch exists to refuse, since config 4 is
# here to show that its OWN root resolves. The two REAL compiles are not
# byte-identical either, and the difference is the sharper reason: 12
# `!DIFile' lines, because a module resolved through an absolute toolchain
# root carries that root's path into the IR (`llvm_split_path',
# llvm/src/ir.mo:979, takes a module's path verbatim). Without the hatch,
# `out4' would be config 3's artifact down to the toolchain path in its

# `[lib] path` is a DECLARATION, and this is the configuration that proves
# resolution follows it rather than assuming the convention. Nothing in the
# monad workspace can prove it: all nine `[lib]` declarations there restate
# the default, so a resolver that ignored the field entirely would pass every
# other check in this repository. The root here is `lib/main.mo` -- a
# different directory AND a different stem, so neither half of the convention
# can answer by accident.

# Two motes, because the declaration has two readers: the mote itself (a bare
# `use lib`, which rewrites to the mote's own name) and a CONSUMER naming it
# as a dependency, which has to read the DEPENDENCY's manifest rather than its
# own. The second is the half that needs the dependency's `mote.toml` opened;
# a resolver that only honoured its own manifest would pass the first and fail
# here.
