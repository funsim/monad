# <root>/dist/ exactly where the release step in .github/workflows/nightly.yml
# uploads from.
#
# The binary itself comes from the flake -- `.#monad` for this machine's
# platform, `.#monad-<platform>` for one it only cross-builds -- and that is
# what a matrix of legs can afford. Both are rung 1, ONE ~26-minute
# interpretation of the compiler by the Rust host, relinked per target in
# seconds; a leg that ran its own interpretation would pay that cost again for
# every platform, and three legs would cost a night three self-compiles.
#
# This used to be four inline `run:` lines in that workflow, and the first
# of them -- `file dist/monad-nightly-x86_64-linux` -- was the only command
# in the repo that ran outside `nix develop`. A bare `run:` gets the
# RUNNER HOST's PATH, not the dev shell's, so `file` was "command not
# found" on the runner while resolving fine for anyone sitting in the dev
# shell whose devenv.nix lists it. Keeping the whole pipeline here, entered
# through `nix develop` -- and locally as `devenv tasks run monad:nightly`,
# or this script directly -- is what makes every tool it uses a declared
# dependency instead of an assumption about the host.
#
# Usage: scripts/nightly-release.sh [platform]
#
# `platform` names the artifacts (`monad-nightly-<platform>`) and, absent an
# argument, comes from an ambient MONAD_PLATFORM and then from this machine's
# own label; see scripts/lib/platform-label.sh. A cross leg must pass its
# TARGET's label, since the binary it stages is named after the platform it is
# for and not after the runner that produced it.
