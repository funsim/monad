#!/usr/bin/env bash
# usage: replay-lsp-session.sh <fixture.jsonl> <command...>
#
# Replays an LSP session against a compiler's `lsp` subcommand and asserts the
# milestone's criteria on the wire. The fixture is a line-per-message script
# (fixtures/lsp/README.md defines the format); the command is the server, and the
# remainder of the command line is its arguments:
#
#   scripts/replay-lsp-session.sh fixtures/lsp/session.jsonl ./out/monad lsp
#   scripts/replay-lsp-session.sh fixtures/lsp/session.jsonl \
#     ./target/release/monad-rs run cli/src/main.mo lsp
#
# The second form is how this was developed -- the Rust host interpreting the
# self-hosted server -- and it is not the gate. The gate is the compiled binary:
# the whole point of the LSP being written in Monad is that it ships in the
# compiler, and the interpreted run says nothing about codegen.
#
# THE SESSION IS RUN ONCE PER ENCODING, because `initialize` may offer one
# encoding per connection. Which one the server picks is the CLIENT's list to
# narrow and the server's to choose from, so a session that needs both runs twice
# with `positionEncodings` a single element. That is also why the encoding is a
# fixture placeholder (`@ENCODINGS@`) rather than a constant: the point of the
# sweep is that every asserted range is a different pair of numbers.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, in the order the fixture asks for it:
#
#   1. `initialize` advertises the five implemented features and echoes the
#      negotiated `positionEncoding` -- and nothing else, since a capability that
#      is advertised and not answered is worse than one never offered.
#   2. The parse-error vector publishes exactly one diagnostic, severity error,
#      source `monad`, and its range matches fixtures/lsp/README.md's hand-computed
#      columns -- which DIFFER between the two encodings. This is the assertion the
#      Rust server this replaces fails.
#   3. A clean file publishes nothing.
#   4. `documentSymbol` answers one symbol per declaration, with the kind the
#      picker's vocabulary gives it and a range that starts at the declaration.
#   5. `hover` on a def and `definition` on a def's use resolve, in the file.
#   6. `definition` on a local that shadows a top-level def answers the TOP-LEVEL
#      def. This one is a PIN ON A KNOWN GAP, not a criterion met: see
#      `lang/src/navigation.mo`'s "Locals are not resolved". It is asserted so that
#      implementing the cursor-to-binding walk flips it.
#   7. `workspace/symbol` finds a declaration in an open buffer.
#   8. A message that is not JSON gets a -32700 error with a null id and the session
#      SURVIVES it -- the next request is still answered.
#   9. A frame truncated by end of input exits cleanly, with no panic.
#  10. No stray bytes on stdout, ever: the protocol stream is the only thing that
#      may be written there, and a diagnostic printed by the check path would look
#      exactly like a client bug.
