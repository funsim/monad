# Stage the SECOND nightly artifact: the mote sources a consumer needs.
#
# The binary alone cannot compile anything outside a compiler checkout. It
# resolves `init`/`std` from CWD-relative literals (`init/src/`, `std/src/`)
# and the C runtime from a workspace-root walk that falls back to
# `runtime/src/runtime.c` (`runtime/src/lib.mo`'s `Runtime.c_path`) -- so
# `use std::map` and every `compile`/`run`/`test` need a checked-out tree,
# which is exactly what an external mote workspace does not have. This
# tarball is the other half: unpacked into the version directory by
# `monadup`, it makes that directory a toolchain root the compiler can find
# (`Mote.toolchain_root`, `lang/src/mote.mo`).
#
# Only the motes a CONSUMER needs are in it. `lang`/`cli` are the compiler
# itself and are already in the binary; shipping them would double the
# artifact for nothing. `src/` goes in wholesale, including the
# `*_tests.mo` modules: that is one rule instead of a filter, and it makes
# the bundle self-testable, because `init`'s `[dev-dependencies.std]`
# resolves inside it.
#
# `llvm` is a consumer dependency even though it is named after the backend
# toolchain rather than after a language feature: it is the LLVM IR data
# model, and `runtime`'s natives are emitted as LLVM IR rather than written
# in C (`runtime/src/natives.mo` uses `llvm::ir`, and `runtime/mote.toml`
# declares the dependency). Leaving it out made the unpacked root a
# workspace whose own `monad check -w` reported `unresolved module: llvm::ir`
# -- a broken bundle, since `runtime` is the one mote every `compile` needs.
#
# Sizes that make this cheap (mote.toml + src, in bytes): init 81904, std
# 152336, runtime 112350, llvm 83933 -- 430 KB of source for the toolchain
# root, against a binary of a few MB.
#
# The generated root manifest is what makes the unpacked directory a
# WORKSPACE rather than four loose motes, so a human can `monad check -w`
# in it and `monadup`'s directory is directly usable as `MONAD_ROOT`.
#
# Usage: scripts/stage-mote-sources.sh [out_dir]   (default: <root>/dist)
