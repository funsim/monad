/// Regression tests for a constructor stealing a call whose head is a LOCAL
/// of the same bare name (`try_compile_constructor_app_db`,
/// `lang/src/codegen/emit.mo`).
///
/// That function already bails out when the bare name is ALSO a real
/// top-level def -- a function/constructor collision -- but it never looked
/// at `c`'s locals, so a parameter or match-arm binder lost to any
/// constructor of the same name anywhere in the whole-program namespace.
/// `compile_call_head`, the fallback it bails out to, checks locals first;
/// this is that check, one level up.
///
/// The blast radius is why these are e2e and not unit tests. `init/src/io.mo`
/// spells `Monad IO`.bind as `match a { io a => f a }`, so a single arity-1
/// constructor named `f` in ANY loaded module compiled `f a` to
/// `alloc_constructor` + `set_field`: bind returned its payload re-wrapped
/// and never invoked the continuation. Every `do` block in the program then
/// silently did nothing -- no output, no crash, and an exit code that varied
/// run to run because `main` unwrapped a field of a constructor that was
/// never the right one. Found on `motes/tui`'s `Key.f (n : I64)`, where it
/// took down all four of that mote's test files while leaving the Rust host
/// completely silent.
