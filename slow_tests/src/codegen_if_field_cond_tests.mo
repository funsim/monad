/// The cause was two layers up from the crash. `type_check_if`
/// (`lang/src/typecheck/infer.mo`) gave the condition the KIND `Type` as
/// its expected type; a field access desugars to a `match`, whose arm type
/// `type_check_cases` unifies against that -- so the def failed to
/// elaborate, `elaborate_module_decls_best_effort` kept it un-elaborated,
/// and the parser's one-binder `field_access_chain` match reached codegen,
/// where `bind_match_fields` reads binder 0 from field 0. At index 0 that
/// is the right field by accident; at index 1 it is an unboxed `I64` that
/// `ensure_i1_cond` then handed to `monad_get_tag` as a pointer.
///
/// Three indices, because one index proves nothing: the pre-fix build was
/// correct at 0 and crashed at 1 and 2. No `#[test]` def reads a field
/// itself -- that takes the FIELD's LLVM type as the def's return type --
/// so every read lives in the compiled source.
