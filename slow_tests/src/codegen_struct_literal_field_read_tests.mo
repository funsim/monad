/// `{ a := s.a, log := s.log : S }` compiled both reads to
/// `monad_get_field(s, 0)`, so a rebuilt struct carried its first field
/// twice. Forge found it as list corruption -- `List.append s.log [v]` on
/// an empty `log` came back with two entries, because `s.log` was really
/// `s.buckets` (`plans/implementations/2026-10-03-any-boxed-struct-
/// reconstruction-corrupts-sibling-field.md`, filed against `Any` and the
/// GC, neither of which was involved).
///
/// The cause: codegen's own `desugar_struct_lits_decls` rewrites an
/// annotated literal to a `Term.con` and leaves the per-arg check to the
/// elaborate pass behind it, and `type_check_con` looked the constructor up
/// under `typ_name ++ [cname]` -- `[S, mk]`, which nothing registers. Every
/// def holding an annotated struct literal therefore failed to elaborate
/// and kept the parser's one-binder field-access match, which
/// `bind_match_fields` reads at index 0.
///
/// Weights are chosen so a wrong index is a different number, and every
/// read lives in the compiled source behind an accessor (a `#[test]` def
/// that reads a field takes the FIELD's LLVM type as its return type).
