/// constructor application inside a single-case match on `x` -- a
/// BRANCHING term, so the arm's value sits in a merge block closed
/// `ret <phi>`. When these rows were written the desugaring built one
/// projection match PER un-overridden field instead of one match over the
/// base (`type_check_struct_update`, `lang/src/typecheck/infer.mo`,
/// changed 2026-10-05 so the base is evaluated once); the composition
/// hazard is the same either way, and so are these rows' numbers. When a field's
/// expression contained a LITERAL operand (`x.f + 1`), that literal
/// argument (no instructions, no blocks) used to be composed via plain
/// `compose_seq`, whose `splice_into_terminal_block` rewrote the
/// projection's merge block from `ret <phi>` to `ret <literal>` --
/// destroying the projected value -- and, since `llvm_value_eq`
/// deliberately never matches literal pairs, left an unmatchable
/// splice-target token so the FOLLOWING compose steps (the arithmetic
/// call, the constructor alloc) all degraded into dead code appended
/// after the branch. The function's real return stayed `ret i64 1`
/// (the raw literal), so every caller did `monad_get_tag` on a small
/// integer and SIGSEGV'd -- the exact crash v29's
/// `module_info_cache_insert`/`module_info_cache_hit` hit on
/// `check examples/hello.mo`.
///
/// `compose_seq_acc` now makes a pure argument a complete no-op at
/// every accumulation site (argument lists, native operands,
/// callee-with-spine): it contributes no code and moves execution
/// nowhere, so the running splice-target token keeps identifying the
/// block execution is actually in. These tests compile each source
/// through the self-hosted backend and run the native binary, so a
/// regression reproduces the miscompile (wrong exit code) rather than
/// just an IR-shape mismatch.
