/// Regression test for `class_method_ref` requiring a class to DECLARE the
/// method its qualifier names (`lang/src/scope.mo`, mirrored in
/// `lang/src/typecheck/infer.mo`'s `ref_names_class_method`).
///
/// The filed repro was `Map.get`: `class Map` declares `empty`/`insert`/
/// `lookup`/`delete` and no `get`, so `Map.get` named a method no class
/// declares -- but the checker accepted it, because the loose test only
/// asked whether the QUALIFIER named a class and then looked the bare
/// suffix up in every class. `get` exists, in `MonadState`. Three measured
/// before-states, all silent:
///
///   * `monad check` reported 0 errors (the checker never looked);
///   * `monad compile` failed with `call to undefined symbol(s):
///     std.map::Map_BTreeMap_get` -- a mangled name nothing emits, because
///     emission is driven by the class's DECLARED method list, and the
///     error names a symbol rather than the line;
///   * with a same-named method on another class that HAS a matching
///     instance, it compiled and ran, dispatching to the OTHER class's
///     method.
///
/// The fixture below is that third shape, self-contained so the row does
/// not depend on which motes a working directory can resolve: `Bag` does
/// not declare `zzz`, `Other` does, and both have an `I64` instance. The
/// call MUST be reachable from `main` -- elaboration and the codegen
/// validator both work on the reachable decls only, so an unreferenced
/// `use_it` would be filtered out and the row would pass for the wrong
/// reason.
///
/// The message is asserted to name the call AS WRITTEN (`Bag.zzz`) and not
/// the other class's promoted def, which is what separates "reported to
/// the user" from "silently rewired to a working symbol".
